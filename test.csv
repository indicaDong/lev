2,"He told LBC 97.3 radio the party had never advocated unilateral disarmament but was currently reviewing its policy.
In recent days, the UKIP leader has faced questions about pledges made in its 2010 general election manifesto.
David Campbell Bannerman, who drew up the 2010 document, said Mr Farage was ""in terrible trouble over policies"".
Mr Farage said the 2010 manifesto had been binned and the party was working on new policies to be unveiled later this year.
Mr Farage stepped down briefly before the last election to concentrate on winning a seat in Parliament and says he was not involved in drawing up the manifesto.
His successor, former Conservative peer Lord Pearson, appeared not to be familiar with much of the policy programme during the 2010 campaign.
Among other things, the manifesto called for taxi drivers to be required to wear uniforms, for British weights and measures to be ""safeguarded"" and for the burka to be banned in public buildings.
In a phone-in on the radio station, Mr Farage said he had already acknowledged that much of the manifesto was ""nonsense"" and UKIP had gone back to a ""blank sheet of paper"" in terms of its preparations for the next election in 2015.
He claimed the document was nothing more a collection of disparate policy papers.
Mr Farage is understood to have fallen out with the main author of the manifesto, David Campbell Bannerman - an MEP who has since rejoined the Conservative Party.
Mr Campbell Bannerman said in an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""I think Nigel is in terrible trouble over policies. He's never believed in them. He's on the ropes.
""We had 18 policy groups, very professional people. It was a very serious paper, but Nigel could not be bothered to read it, anything to do with policy. I'm afraid it's not good enough for someone who claims to be a serious political leader.
""You're dealing with someone who isn't bothered, isn't serious, is a bit of a joker, and it's not good enough. It's not a political party. It's a pressure group"".
Mr Farage signed the foreword to the 2010 manifesto as the ""chief party spokesman,"" along with Lord Pearson and Mr Campbell Bannerman.
It said ""While withdrawal from the European Union superstate is central to UKIP's message, the party has a full range of policies that have helped it grow to become Britain's fourth largest political party.""
Mr Farage also launched the manifesto at a press conference in Westminster, saying it was time for ""straight talking"" in British politics.
Explaining why he had now disowned the document, he told LBC: ""Malcolm Pearson, who was leader at the time, was picked up in interviews for not knowing the manifesto.
""Of course he didn't - it was 486 pages of excessive detail. Eighteen months ago I said I want the whole lot taken down, we reject the whole thing...
""I didn't read it. It was drivel. It was 486 pages of drivel...It was a nonsense. We have put that behind us and moved onto a professional footing.""
But he said he was ""really annoyed"" by suggestions that UKIP, whose main policy remains taking Britain out of the EU, was not committed to Trident - the independent submarine-based ballistic missile weapons system which dates back to the 1960s.
He rejected suggestions that calls to scrap Trident had appeared at one stage on the party's official website.
""On a discussion forum, about a year ago, someone put up an idea, a policy proposal saying 'what if we scrapped Trident'.
""It has never been adopted or accepted as UKIP policy. It has never formally been put out there as UKIP policy.""
UKIP's 2010 manifesto called for Trident to be retained and ultimately be replaced by ""four British-built submarines armed with US missiles"".
The policy is currently being reviewed and would set out it in detail during the summer, Mr Farage added.
""We have been thinking very hard what to do with Trident...but it will not involve scrapping Trident.
""I think there is an argument that, in tight times, we could go down from four to three submarines, but I think we need to maintain the independent nuclear deterrent.""
The government has delayed a decision on the future of Trident until 2016 amid divisions between the two coalition partners.
The Conservatives back like-for-like renewal, but the Lib Dems want a ""slimmed-down"" version, with a maximum of three submarines.","The UK Independence Party would not scrap Trident, Nigel Farage has said, describing the manifesto that contained the policy as ""drivel""."

4,"Uber presented the offer as an attempt to improve its relationship with London's cabbies.
But a cab drivers' association said it would be ""amazed if any drivers decide to take up Uber's offer"".
And rival Hailo described the offer as ""posturing"", saying it doubted the move would calm matters.
There has been friction between Uber and some cabbies, who have said the app is ""unfair competition"".
Uber said that from Tuesday, it would waive its 5% commission for black taxis for a year.
Jo Bertram, regional general manager of Uber in the UK, said: ""London's cabs are famous the world over because they are an iconic part of our city's transport infrastructure.
""It's why the impact of apps like Uber on traditional taxis has generated such a heated debate in the capital.
""We believe that black cabs and Uber can coexist.""
Ms Bertram said in a blog post that the Knowledge, which requires four years of study by aspiring black cab drivers to memorise London streets and landmarks, was ""an onerous test"" which could be completed more quickly in ""the age of GPS and live traffic apps"".
But Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA), said: ""With over 15,000 cabbies registered with specific taxi-hailing apps like Gett and Hailo, we would be amazed if any drivers decide to take up Uber's offer.""
He said the Uber offer was ""just another PR stunt from a company that spends Â£250,000 every month on lobbying and PR"".
""The response is 'Thanks, but no thanks',"" he added.
The offer has been launched on the eve of a planned protest by cabbies affiliated with a separate drivers' association, the United Cabbies Group.
Mr McNamara said the protest had not be organised by LTDA, but that ""cabbies have a right to make their voices heard"".
Len Martin, chairman of the United Cabbies Group, said: ""The taxi trade neither want nor welcome any such offer from an outfit that will tarnish our reputation by association.""
A number of protests against Uber have been held by taxi drivers around the world, including protests in London.
Hailo chief executive Andrew Pinnington told the BBC that given the history of the relationship between Uber and black cabs, he doubted that cabbies would take up the offer.
He said Ms Bertram had appeared to offer an olive branch, but in fact had ""called into question"" the Knowledge, which cabbies hold dear, and also the vehicles themselves.
""Uber will have come under a lot of pressure around the globe because of challenges to incumbent bodies,"" he said. ""There's an element here of posturing.""
""They [Uber] are trying to send out the message, 'We are doing our best to reach across,' but I don't think there is serious intent.""
Hailo is one of the major ride-hailing apps used by black cabs in London. Mr Pinnington said about 15,500 cabbies used the app, out of a total of 25,000.
Of the black cabs that use Hailo, on average between 15% and 20% of their work comes through the app, he added.",Cabbies have rejected an offer from Uber which would allow them to use the taxi-hailing app for nothing for a year.

8,"The Microsoft-owned chat app said that the move reflected the public preference for using mobile devices to make video calls from the living room, despite the size advantage TVs offered.
It will continue to maintain the service until June.
Afterwards, it will be up to individual manufacturers to decide whether to remove the app or continue offering an unsupported service.
Skype's intention to focus its efforts on phones and tablets comes at a time when it faces heightened competition.
Although Google's rival Hangouts service has had limited appeal on mobiles, Facebook's Messenger and Apple's Facetime apps are making more headway.
In addition, Xiaomi recently launched its own Mi Video Call service, and Slack has announced plans to add support for video chats to its popular business-focused chat tool.
Skype for TV was first unveiled at the CES tech show in January 2010 and was marketed as a way to let families ""share the limelight [from their sofa] so there's no more huddling around the computer or missing an out-of-shot moment"".
It required TVs to be fitted with either a built-in camera or a plug-in peripheral.
TV-makers that adopted the service included Samsung, LG, Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Philips.
""Over the years, users have changed the way they use Skype, with the majority accessing it from a mobile device - including when in the living room,"" reads a message posted to the app's support page.
""We want to make sure we prioritise delivering the best possible experience to the platforms our users are asking for, which is why we've decided to focus our efforts in other areas while supporting key functionality on Skype for TV for as long as possible.""
Samsung has already announced that its TVs will stop offering the app from 2 June.
Many science-fiction movies and comics had envisioned that people would want to chat to each other via large screens in their homes.
But one expert said that technology had gone down a ""very different route"".
""On paper the idea of using a TV for things like Skype made a lot of sense - it's a non-threatening device that people were already comfortable with, so it seemed a good way to get the tech into the living room,"" said Chris Green, a technology analyst at the consultancy Lewis.
""But the ubiquity of mobile devices made video conferencing on TVs redundant.
""No-one ever got used to using a big screen for Skype because they never needed to - people are far more used to picking up a tablet and doing it that way - and I don't think there's a way back now.""",Skype has announced that it is ending support for its smart TV software.
9,"In the first meeting between the two since Mr Buhari's election, Mr Obama said the Nigerian leader had a ""very clear agenda"" for defeating extremism.
The US has committed $5 million (Â£3.2m; â‚¬4.6m) to the fight against Boko Haram since Mr Buhari came to power.
The jihadists have killed thousands in north-east Nigeria since 2009.
Speaking after the two met at the White House, Mr Obama called Nigeria one of the most important countries on the African continent and praised Mr Buhari for tackling corruption, an issue which compromised Washington's relationship with the Nigerian leader's predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan.
Boko Haram has carried out attacks in northern Nigeria since its insurgency began in 2009, most notably the April 2014 kidnapping of 276 Nigerian school girls who are still missing.
President Obama's wife Michelle got involved in an online campaign to draw attention to the girls' plight, #BringBackOurGirls, and the US sent surveillance flights over Nigeria to help locate them.
However, the US refuses to sell weapons to Nigeria because of concerns over its army's human rights record.
Mr Buhari wrote in an article published in The Washington Post just before meeting Mr Obama that ""our allies can provide much-needed military training and intelligence as our soldiers take the war effort to Boko Haram"".
Mr Obama did not give any indication after his meeting with Mr Buhari that the US would provide military assistance to Nigeria.
Mr Buhari  also wrote that he was seeking US assistance in ""locating and returning $150 billion in funds stolen in the past decade and held in foreign bank accounts on behalf of former, corrupt officials"".
At the outset of the meeting, President Obama praised the March elections won by Mr Buhari as ""an affirmation of Nigeria's commitment to democracy"".
President Buhari replied by saying Nigeria will ""ever be grateful"" for the US help in ensuring the elections were free fair and credible.
Mr Buhari, a former military ruler, was invited to Washington shortly after becoming the first opposition candidate to win a national election in March.

Nigeria is seeking US co-operation in combating Boko Haram militants.
The US had previously agreed to help Nigeria fight the insurgency, especially after more than 200 school girls were kidnapped by the militants group from their dormitory in Chibok early last year.
However, relations between the US and the administration of Nigeria's former President, Goodluck Jonathan, soured, amid accusations of human rights violations by the Nigerian military.
President Buhari will also seize the opportunity to seek US assistance to recover billions of dollars from bank accounts in the United States, Switzerland and elsewhere.
The US and other G7 countries had promised to assist Nigeria discover the money - if the country could provide evidence that it had been stolen from the country.
Nigeria will also need US assistance in the fight against corruption, which is one of the issues the country's president had promised to tackle during his campaign days.

14,"The data, from almost six million people, adds to growing evidence that smoking and type 2 diabetes are linked.
If the link is proven, efforts to reduce smoking could have a big impact on tackling diabetes worldwide, say researchers.
An international team pulled together data from 88 studies on smoking risk and type 2 diabetes.
They found that current smokers had about 1.4 times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with non-smokers.
Although the risk of diabetes went up slightly (to about 1.5 times) for several years after quitting smoking, it fell to about 1.2 times after five years of not smoking.
Commenting on the research, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, called on doctors to mention smoking as a risk factor for diabetes.
""They should mention that, as well as being a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and many cancers, smoking should also be regarded as a risk factor for diabetes (albeit with a small effect relative to, for example, lung cancer),"" he said.
The research adds to evidence of a link between smoking and type 2 diabetes, but does not prove that smoking directly causes it.
The experts estimate that 12% of global diabetes cases in men and 2% in women could be due to cigarette smoking, if a causal link were proven.
Dr Richard Elliott, of the charity Diabetes Research UK, said it was important to stress that people with diabetes were at increased risk of cardiovascular complications, so smoking was even more harmful for people with diabetes than for people without the condition.
""So the strong advice is that if you smoke, whether or not you have diabetes, giving up is the single most important thing you can do for your future health,"" he said.","Smokers who quit could lower their risk of type 2 diabetes in the long term, research suggests."

Firemen are battling the third in a series of blazes that began on Monday, when an oil leak caught fire and spread to nearby tanks.
More than 14,000 residents in the surrounding area have been evacuated, reported state news agency Xinhua.
Six people have been hospitalised for minor injuries, while 13 are receiving medical attention, said CCTV.

But another tank containing nearly 1,500 tonnes of hydrocarbon liquid caught fire and exploded early on Wednesday morning.
The plant produces the chemical paraxylene which is used for fibre and plastics.
Authorities said that the fires were reigniting due to residue being exposed to the air.
Experts interviewed by Xinhua said that the layer of foam sprayed by firefighters to cover the residue was becoming unstable due to the heat and was disintegrating, and was being shifted by strong winds.",Thousands have been evacuated in the southern Chinese province of Fujian as a massive chemical oil fire reignited.
16,"The Resolution Foundation says that about half of the 4.8 million people classified as self-employed are low-paid and earn less than £310 a week.
As they have no chance to set their own wages they should be classified instead as workers, with wage protection.
Are you self-employed and think you should be getting workers' rights? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk and include your telephone number.
The idea received endorsement from the former head of the Low Pay Commission and CBI, Lord Adair Turner.
He told the BBC that certain companies in the gig economy have been operating successfully by avoiding paying minimum wage or employee contributions.
""I think the scale of it is probably sufficient that we should tighten up on that. Essentially we should enforce the minimum wage on those categories of the self-employed who, when when you look at them are essentially employed in the fundamental nature of how their work is organised.""
The idea has been submitted by the Resolution Foundation to the Taylor Review on modern employment practices.
Mathew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Arts, was appointed last October by the government to lead a review into the effect of new types of businesses, such as Uber and Deliveroo, which have led to an increase in the number of people in short-term and casual work.
Conor D'Arcy of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""While many [of the self-employed] are higher earners who benefit from significant flexibility, around half fall below the low pay earnings threshold of just £310 a week.""
""The government can start by extending minimum wage protections to those self-employed people whose prices are set by a firm.
""This would mean that self-employed people in the gig economy would be given protection against extreme low pay for the first time ever,"" he added.
By law most workers are entitled to the National Minimum Wage and the rate they receive depends on their age.
Currently for 21-24-year-olds the rate is £7.05 per hour, for 18-20 year olds £5.60 and for 16-17 year olds £4.05. The apprentice rate is £3.50.
If you are over 25 the National Living Wage applies to you. That is currently set at £7.50 an hour.
The independent Low Pay Commission advises the government on those rates.
You will also hear a third type of wage referred to - the ""real living wage"". It is calculated annually by the Living Wage Foundation, an independent group.
The rate, which is not statutory, represents ""what employees and their families need to live"", and organisations that pay it receive accreditation from the foundation.
For the UK it stands at £8.45 per hour and in London at £9.75 an hour.
The Resolution Foundation argues that the test of whether people are really self-employed or simply disguised workers should be whether or not the employer sets the price for the work they do.
If applied, that test would affect some well-known industries.
""Affected firms would include gig economy-style platforms claiming to simply connect the self-employed to customers but setting the price for work done, or those with standard terms that they apply to a significant number of the self-employed,"" it says.
That would mean a big change for tens of thousands of workers, such as 170,000 self-employed Uber and minicab drivers, 40,000 postal and courier staff, 150,000 hairdressers and 80,000 cleaners.
Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""It would be helpful if a better distinction could be made between real entrepreneurs and those who, in all but name, have the appearance of being employed by giant corporations.""
In May, the Parliamentary Work and Pensions Committee reported after an inquiry that self-employed status had left some workers vulnerable to ""exploitation"".
The committee said that drivers and couriers for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo needed full workers' rights and not ""bogus"" self-employment status.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) said it agreed that the status of workers should be clarified by the government, with the publication of easy-to-understand guidance.
But Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the IoD, said undermining the gig economy would bring disadvantages.
""Evidence from the Labour Force Survey and the ONS suggest that easier routes into self-employment have also led to rising workplace participation for those who have historically struggled to find a job; notably single parents, disabled individuals, and the long-term unemployed,"" he said.
""An obligatory minimum wage would undermine the business model of many gig platforms, such as taxi, delivery or cleaning services, who would find it hard to justify paying people at times when there was no demand.""","Some of the self-employed should be entitled to the national minimum wage, a think tank has urged."
17,"The 30-year-old has been confirmed as England's captain for the Six Nations by coach Eddie Jones - two days after his six-week suspension for hitting Leinster's Sean O'Brien ended.
Hartley will not have played for nine weeks before England's opening game against France on 4 February.
""I did think that maybe that was it,"" Hartley told BBC Sport.
""But again, a conversation with Eddie - a very clear and direct conversation - and I know where I stand,"" he added.
Hartley, who led England to the Grand Slam last year, was banned in December after he caught the Irish flanker with a swinging arm during Northampton's 37-10 Champions Cup loss. It was the third red card of his career.
The subsequent suspension took the total number of weeks he has been unavailable during his career to 60.
""I obviously came back to Northampton and wanted to make a positive impact in a big game for the club,"" said Hartley. ""It obviously went horribly wrong.
""Positive, dominant, hard tackle. That's what I was thinking. Obviously the outcome was different to what I intended.
""That walk off the field is never a quick moment. It seems to drag on for quite a while, but obviously gives you time to reflect and I understand I could have jeopardised a lot.
""I put myself and the team in a difficult position and since then I've had clear directives from the management of what they expect and here I am.""
Hartley said that part of the directive from Jones was to improve his tackle technique.
""I've worked very hard with [England defence coach] Paul Gustard on that,"" added Hartley. ""It's not something that just finishes now that I'm back playing. It's an ongoing thing.""

19,"It marked the end of an epic 36-hour rescue operation after the collapse of an under-construction flyover in the city.
Rescuers worked through the night in the Girish Park area, where the bypass collapsed, killing at least 24 people and injuring hundreds.
The exhaustion of their exertions was written in the faces of the rescue workers. Their uniforms were dusty and their hair was matted with sweat as they sat, shoulders slumped, on girders and mounds of rubble around the site.
What had been an effort to save survivors and recover bodies became something much simpler: a clean-up job.
In came the mechanical diggers, hefting great loads of debris onto the backs of battered trucks.
This would normally be one of the busiest parts of one of India's busiest cities and all around was evidence of the scale of the tragedy: a twisted and burnt motorcycle, the shattered remains of an auto-rickshaw, a discarded handbag and - amongst the wreckage - tattered banners of flapping fabric.
Volunteers handed out clay cups of hot sweet tea to rescue workers and gawkers alike.
There was still a buzz of curious excitement among those gathered to watch the operation, but the atmosphere was slowly and subtly beginning to change.
As the urgency and adrenaline that had sustained people during the long night began to drain away, it was replaced by growing anger.
The people straining at the security barriers erected to protect the site wanted to know why what should have been a fairly straightforward construction project ended in such terrible disaster.
They were asking whether the company building the overpass had been cutting corners. Was it rushing to finish the much-delayed project because of pressure from the state government? Why was a company that had been blacklisted by a number of Indian states still involved in the first place?
Every now and then a senior military officer or a politician would sweep through to slowly inspect the site followed by crowds of camera crews and photographers.
The state elections are just days away and this disaster is a huge political issue, not just here in Bengal but across India.
The ugly spectacle of blame and recrimination has well and truly begun.
But great tragedies are the true test of a community. And Kolkata came up trumps.
The city came together in the wake of the disaster to offer solace and support.
Just as everyone's energy was flagging near noon on Friday, a group of Sikhs brought huge steaming pots of rice and dhal (lentils) and served it to whoever was hungry in plates made of pressed leaves.
Even in the darkest moments there is light.","At around 8am (02:30GMT) this morning, specialist rescue workers in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta) recovered what was to be the last body from a rubble of shattered concrete and the tangle of steel."
20,"In the Channel Islands the upkeep of churches is paid for through Parish Rates, which everyone has to pay.
But Leo Thomas said he finds it ""extremely questionable"" he should pay for a church that ""openly discriminates against the gay community"".
The Anglican Dean of Guernsey said he would respond to Mr Thomas privately.
More on the church rates story, and other news
Mr Thomas wrote the open letter to ask to be removed from paying church rates ""due to the Church of England's institutional homophobic stance on gay marriage"".
He wrote: ""As a person classed as a sinner and not worthy to get married in a church why should I be obliged and forced to pay a penny towards the costs of said church?
""If the Church of England was a private company, I probably would have a strong case of discrimination in court.""
He said this year he would donate the Â£7.94 he paid for his 2016 church rates to a local charity instead.
The central government on the island is the States of Guernsey, but each parish also has its own douzaine.
Parish Rates, separated in owner and refuse rates, are charged to cover the cost of services provided by the douzaine, which are determined by the value of the owner's property, similar to Council Tax.
Services provided include rubbish and recycling collection, licensing, boat moorings, highways, planning permission and the upkeep of parish churches.
Both the Anglican Dean of Guernsey the Very Reverend Tim Barker, and the constables of St Andrew's Parish, where Mr Thomas lives, have declined to comment.
Same-sex marriage in Guernsey was approved in December but the law has not yet come into effect, but is expected to this summer.
Deputy Peter Ferbrache said he is against any form of discrimination and sympathises with Mr Thomas, but said he disagrees with withholding rates contributions.
""I regard the church buildings as an important part of our heritage. They should be preserved. ""","A gay man from Guernsey has refused to pay for the upkeep of his parish church because of its ""homophobic stance on gay marriage""."
21,"Bill Bett, from Markinch, bought the Monopoly Millionaire card from his local Co-op on 1 June.
""When I saw the amount it didn't really click at first. On the card it reads 1MIL and I thought what does this mean - I've won a pint of milk?"" he said.
But the shop confirmed to the 69-year-old he had indeed won the top prize.
""I went back into the shop and asked them to check it. They confirmed that I had won and that I'd have to call the Lottery line. I couldn't believe it but I actually remained quite calm,"" Mr Bett said.
""When I got home I phoned my three sisters who all thought I was winding them up. But they said it couldn't have happened to a better brother and are so happy for me.""
Mr Bett then tucked the scratchcard behind the cover of his tablet to keep it safe until it was validated a week later.
He said he had already bought a new bungalow to help with health issues which mean that he struggles with stairs.

22,"Rutgers University Athletic Director Tim Pernetti only suspended and fined coach Mike Rice after viewing a video of him berating and hitting players.
Mr Rice eventually lost his job this week as clips of his furious rants were aired on national TV networks.
But as Mr Rice was not fired earlier, he is due a $100,000 (Â£65,000) bonus.
His contract entitled him to the cash reward for finishing the 2012-13 season.
Critics of the New Jersey university say Mr Rice should have been fired when administrators first saw the video last year.
In his resignation letter, Mr Pernetti said he hoped his tenure at Rutgers would ""not be judged by this one incident"".
The 42-year-old added that when he first saw the video, his ""first instincts... was to fire him immediately"".
However, he said the consensus at the time was ""university policy would not justify dismissal"".
In an earlier statement, Mr Pernetti said that it had been his decision to ""rehabilitate"" Mr Rice, ""but I was wrong"".
The footage, shown for the first time publicly on sport broadcaster ESPN on Tuesday, was shot during team practices between 2010-12.
Mr Rice is seen shouting homophobic slurs, hurling balls at players, kicking, pushing and grabbing them.
At a campus news conference on Friday, university president Robert Barchi said: ""I want to apologise to the entire Rutgers community for the negative impact that this situation has had on Rutgers.
""I also apologise to the LGBTQ community and all of us who share their values for the homophobic slurs shown on that video. I personally know how hurtful that language can be.""

23,"Gareth Doulas, 37, from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, had been preparing to climb Everest when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck a week ago.
More than 7,000 people are now known to have died and 14,000 have been injured.
Stranded at North Base Camp, Mr Douglas was hoping to join the relief effort in Kathmandu, but was unable to reach the city.
""It seemed like the right thing to do,"" he said.
""I'd studied first aid, so I felt like I could be of some use and we had a doctor and a nurse on the team.
""But the roads were completely destroyed and we couldn't get there by air either.""
Mr Douglas flew into Heathrow from Lhasa on Saturday.
He said the earthquake caused ""boulders the size of cars"" to crash down the mountain, but the scale of the disaster was not immediately clear.
""We had one climber with a broken leg and no deaths, so very lucky. South Base Camp was worse hit. It was only later we found out quite how bad it was.""
The sherpas supporting Mr Douglas's team were from Kathmandu and initially there was no word on whether their families had survived. Like the climbing team they were stranded in North Base Camp for a few days.
""We gave them the tip money and just said 'go back, be with your families.'
""Their families were ok, but their houses were gone and they were sleeping on the streets.""
Leaving Everest also meant abandoning a ""huge dream"" to climb the mountain.
""I was feeling strong, feeling good. We'd got to the top of the North Col and I felt like I was capable of going further.
""I'd been thinking about it [Everest] for years. It cost me a total of about Â£30,000 including travel, climbing permits and kit.
""I'd quit my job and sold my house in California to fund it. But money doesn't matter next to lives.""
Mr Douglas said he had moved to the USA to pursue his dream of living and climbing in the mountains.
""The feeling of standing on a summit, especially the high altitude ones, is amazing.""
He said he ""can't wait"" to return to Everest and said he might make another attempt next year, if the climbing permit could be transferred.
A friend of Mr Douglas's family, Sue Markham, from Albrighton, said her 18-year-old daughter had been caught up in the aftermath of the earthquake while on a gap year, but had received ""no help"" from the British embassy in Kathmandu.
Meanwhile, Ed Hullah, a paramedic from south Shropshire, is preparing to join the relief effort.

He is believed to have suffered stab wounds to his upper body.
It happened at Summerhill Park in the Twinbrook area and was reported to police at about 02:40 BST on Saturday.
The 32-year-old man was arrested in the Dunmurry area and is being questioned on suspicion of murder.
Det Ch Insp John McVea said: ""We are currently investigating the circumstances which led to the death of such a young man as Eamonn, who is a son, a brother, a partner and a friend.
""I would therefore appeal to anyone who saw or heard any dispute in the Summerhill Park area, or who knows anything about this murder, to contact detectives at Lisburn police station on the non-emergency number 101.""

It said the planned transformation of services was designed to make them more efficient and customer focused.
Savings suggestions include offering more online, having a neighbourhood approach for face-to-face services and reducing voluntary grants by 10%.
Council officials will now consult with staff and unions, insisting the changes will make the organisation leaner and more efficient.
Alasdair Rankin, Edinburgh city council's finance convener, said: ""The council needs to take significant steps to tackle the financial challenges it faces as demand for our services continues to increase.
""At the same time, we want to make services for residents more efficient and effective.
""We set the direction of travel last month when council agreed proposals for a new organisational structure, enabling more effective decision making at neighbourhood level and improved partnership working with third sector organisations.
""We are now considering detailed proposals around this and how we plan to improve the way we interact with residents.""

Mr Hunt provided a break down of the cost of providing evidence, in a written statement to Parliament.
It showed the majority of the £6m total (£5,227,000) was spent on legal advice.
The remainder covered the cost of dedicated staff working to prepare the evidence, their travel and subsistence expenses, and ""other directly related costs"".
Mr Francis's inquiry looked at why the scandal at Stafford Hospital - where there was a higher-than-expected number of deaths as a result of abuse and neglect in 2005-08 - was not picked up earlier.
The inquiry ran for a year between 2010 and 2011, and took evidence from more than 160 witnesses over 139 days, at a cost of £13m.
More than a million pages of evidence were submitted.
The report concluded that patients had been ""betrayed"" because the NHS put corporate self-interest ahead of patients.
It argued for ""fundamental change"" in the culture of the NHS to make sure patients were put first.
In his written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt told Parliament officials had compiled the cost of submitting evidence to the inquiry.
""I can now report to the House that  the expenditure incurred by the Department and NHS organisations in their role as witnesses amounted to £6m.""
He said the government would publish a further response to the Francis report this autumn.
The findings of the Francis report into failings at Mid Staffs prompted a separate review of 14 NHS hospitals in England with high mortality rates.

AkzoNobel has been trying to repel the bid by announcing plans to spin off its chemicals unit and return most of the proceeds to shareholders.
PPG said the new offer was AkzoNobel's last chance to accept the deal.
""We are extending this one last invitation to you and the  AkzoNobel boards to reconsider your stance and to engage with us on creating extraordinary value and benefits for all of AkzoNobel's stakeholders,"" said PPG's chairman and chief executive, Michael McGarry.
""Our revised proposal represents a second increase in price along with significant and highly-specific commitments that we are confident  AkzoNobel's stakeholders will find compelling,"" he added.
The revised offer, in a mixture of cash and PPG shares, would value AkzoNobel at 24.6bn euros which, PPG said, was a 50% premium over the the Dutch group's value as of 8 March.
The latest offer is critical of AkzoNobel's own plan, announced on 19 April, to split the Netherlands-based group into two: one part concentrating on paint and the other on chemicals.
PPG said: ""As evidenced by the decline in AkzoNobel's stock price since its investor update, the capital markets have not recognized any additional value from its new standalone plan, including the enhanced regular dividend and special dividend that AkzoNobel has proposed for 2017.""
""One of the more notable risks of AkzoNobel's new standalone plan is that it creates two smaller, unproven standalone companies with uncertain market valuations and substantial risks.
""AkzoNobel's standalone plan also will require substantial restructuring; potentially decreases free cash flow, putting future and accelerated growth plans of the demerged companies at risk,"" added PPG.
PPG said that by contrast a merger of the two firms would lead to savings of at least $750m a year for the combined firm.
To make the suggested deal more acceptable to shareholders and other stakeholders in the Netherlands, the latest PPG offer outlines a long list of commitments to retain AkzoNobel's links with that country:",US paint firm PPG has increased its proposed  bid for Dulux owner AkzoNobel for the second time.

Three people have already died in the Queensland flooding, after a cyclone brought heavy rain.
Australian PM Julia Gillard offered her condolences to the families of victims.
Ms Gillard was speaking in Gipsland, Victoria, where she was visiting people afflicted by the recent wildfires.
She said it had been a ""tough period"" for Queensland, and that the whole country was being ""challenged by nature"".
""But we are a strong and smart nation and we'll get through this, as we always do, by pulling together,"" she said.
Floods in late 2010 and early 2011 left 35 people dead across Queensland, with Bundaberg among the towns affected.
In 2010, the Burnett River at Bundaberg reached 7.92 metres, but at 15:00 (05:00 GMT) on Monday, the river was at 9.2m and rising slowly, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) said in a statement.
It is expected to peak late on Tuesday or early Wednesday. Major flooding has also been reported at Mundubbera and Gayndah, said the BoM.
State premier Cambell Newman said it was ""a major flood crisis for the people of Queensland"".
""However they're up to the challenge. We will get through this. There is a team there working hard, state and local government, to protect them, to rescue them, to make sure that in the days and weeks to come we clean up and put it all back together.""
Mr Newman said the north of the city had been split into several islands and that rescue workers were trying to reach hundreds of people still trapped.
He said 14 helicopters had been plucking people from rooftops but that more were being brought in, and some would work throughout the evening. He urged stranded people to group together and ensure less mobile people were not left behind.
Preparation were also being made to evacuate more than 100 people from the city's hospital, he said.
The authorities were ""very concerned about what may happen this evening"".
Residents had earlier been ordered to evacuate immediately, with the state's Police Commissioner Ian Stewart tweeting: ""Do not wait. Move now. Yr life depends on it.""
Police Superintendent Rowan Bond said many people had only a few hours left in which to leave, before becoming stranded, saying there was an ""imminent danger of people being killed and drowned"".
By late afternoon, the main Bundaberg evacuation centre at Oakwood State School was itself evacuated, the Brisbane Times reports. Some 300 people were being moved to another centre near the airport.
Elsewhere in the state, some 350 homes have been flooded in Ipswich. More than 200,00 people are without power across the state. Residents of the Lockyer Valley, which was the scene of deadly flash floods in 2011, have also been told to evacuate as creeks and rivers rise.
The town of Gympie has been cut off and dozens of businesses are underwater, ABC News reports, while hundreds of homes are threatened in Ipswich, where the Bremer River is expected to peak later in the day.
Police said the body of an elderly man who went to check on a yacht north of Bundaberg had been recovered on Sunday. Two men swept away by flooding in separate incidents in Queensland were also found dead on Monday.
In Brisbane, which was paralysed by flooding two years ago, water has been creeping into low-lying parts of the central business district.
A woman and her three-year-old son were also taken to hospital in Brisbane after a tree fell on them.
The rain was brought by Tropical Cyclone Oswald, which is now affecting the northern part of New South Wales.

Every day this hospital sees hundreds of people with the high fever and agonising joint pain that has earned dengue its alternate name: breakbone fever.
Security guards have been deployed to keep order but even so fights are still common. People are that desperate to see a doctor.
Delhi is in the grip of its worst outbreak of dengue in years.  According to the official figures, 25,000 people have been infected in India this year.  The real figure is believed to be hundreds of times higher.
And the scale of the outbreak means hospitals have to make tough decisions.
One the day we visit, it is Dr Sonali Chaturvedi's job to decide who gets admitted.  She says she turns nine out of 10 people away.
Most people recover after a week or two of severe illness, but a few will go on to develop the most serious and life-threatening form of the disease.
That's when the plasma starts to leak out of patients' blood vessels.  It is known as dengue haemorrhagic fever.
The medical director of the hospital, Dr Hemant Sharma, leads me through wards full of dengue sufferers.
Ceiling fans churn the torpid air above the rows of beds.  Space is so short some patients have to share a bed.
And, Dr Sharma says, that's after the hospital has cancelled all emergency surgery to free up more wards for dengue.
All government doctors have been told they can't take any leave until the disease subsides and that won't happen for weeks - until the first winter chills kill off the mosquitoes that carry the disease.
There is no vaccination to protect you from dengue, and no cure if you contract the disease, so the only way to tackle dengue is to get to the root cause.
In a narrow alley in Delhi's old town I meet up with a team of 30 government employees, some of up to 10,000 who are sent out into the city each day to warn of the dangers of dengue and to try and hunt down the aedes mosquitoes that carry it.
The only way is to go house to house, checking for anything that could hold even a tiny puddle of water.
Babita Bisht, who is in charge of the small team, tells me aedes mosquitoes can breed in just a few millimetres of clear water.
She's a trained entomologist - an insect expert - and I'm surprised when she tells me she loves the aedes mosquito and loves to find it breeding.
After less than half an hour a shout goes up. One of the team has found a water vessel on the roof of one of the houses.  Hundreds of aedes larvae squirm and wriggle inside.
The family that live here will face a fine designed, says Babita, to encourage people to take more care to get rid of anything the mosquitoes could breed in.
Dengue is a disease of modernity.  Fifty years ago just a couple of countries reported dengue outbreaks, now it is endemic in more than 120 nations.
The transport networks that knit our world together have spread the mosquitoes across the world and the explosion in urban living over the same period has ensured a ready supply of people to feed on and all sorts of new habitats to live in.
Over the last few decades the rate of infection has increased thirtyfold, says Neena Valecha, a world expert on dengue and the head of India's national mosquito research centre.
The mortality rate is fewer than one in a hundred but with the World Health Organisation estimates there at least 100 million infections a year so it is still a very serious health issue.
And she warns that dengue will continue to spread out across the world.
Climate change is likely to make the warm, wet conditions dengue mosquitoes love even more common.
Dengue fever is prevalent in sub-tropical and tropical regions, including South East Asia and South America
It is a major cause of illness worldwide, causing about 100 million episodes of feverish illness a year
Symptoms include high fever, aching joints and vomiting
Complications can prove fatal in extreme cases

Oman, whose target was revised first to 152 in 16 overs then 120 in 12 after rain in Dharamsala, laboured to 65-9.
As winners of Group A, Bangladesh join India, Australia, South Africa and Pakistan's group in the next phase.
Tournament newcomers Oman, who beat Ireland in their opening game, can take considerable credit for finishing second in a group containing three teams above them in the T20 rankings.
Earlier, Ireland finished bottom of Group B after losing to the Netherlands by 12 runs in a match reduced to six overs per side by rain.
Four of the six games played in Dharamsala were affected by the weather.
Tamim, on four, offered a tough caught-and-bowled chance to Amir Ali in the second over, a fierce drive which brought him the first of his 10 fours to complement five sixes.
Mixing powerful drives and pulls with deft sweeps and late cuts, he dominated a second-wicket stand of 97 in 9.1 overs with Sabbir, whose innings also featured plenty of clean hitting.
Oman's spinners came in for particularly harsh treatment as left-hander Tamim converted a 35-ball fifty into a 60-ball century, almost injuring himself as he leapt in the air in celebration.
""It was fun,"" said Tamim. ""I told my coach I would give him a hundred in this World Cup. It feels good that I kept my promise.""
The Oman pursuit was checked by the loss of two early wickets, then made almost impossible by two rain delays, the second of which - at 45-4 - left them needing 75 off 22 balls.

Ipswich Crown Court heard three men - one armed with a sawn-off shotgun - barged into Mr Catchpole's home.
During police interviews heard in court, Mr Catchpole told officers: ""One of the guys said: 'Rebecca wants you dead....so I knew what it was about.
In the ""tussle"" which ensued, he was hit over the head, and felt warm blood running down his face. He tried to grab the shotgun and push it away.
""I heard a bang, and there was a smell, and I looked down and there was a hole in my chest and blood was spurting out of it,"" he said.
He described how the trio ran off and he went outside knocking at the doors of his neighbours, before eventually collapsing in the street, struggling to breathe.
People came to his aid and he was taken to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery.
Shotgun pellets, wadding and shrapnel were all found inside his body, but not all could be removed, he said.

In that time, they have conceded 13 goals in defeats by Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Everton and now QPR.
QPR, however, are showing signs of improvement - building on an impressive display in last weekend's 3-2 defeat by Liverpool.
With Zamora supporting Austin up front, they have struck upon a partnership which can cause opposition defences problems.
Austin's brace was significant in that it lifted Rangers off the bottom of the league for the first time in almost a month - at the expensive of his former club, Burnley.

If his opening goal was a surprise - coming after Villa had caught out the hosts three times on the counter and seen Carlos Sanchez test Rob Green with a 30-yard shot - the second was reward for a change in tack from Harry Redknapp.
While Zamora was causing the Villa defence problems with his physical presence, he once again tired as the second half wore on and, perhaps sensing the need to inject some width into a congested contest, Rangers boss Redknapp replaced the former England striker with winger Junior Hoilett.
Almost immediately, Hoilett cut in from the left and curled a right-footed shot against the post.
Moments later, Sanchez needlessly gave the ball away and Vargas powered down the right before putting in the perfect delivery for Austin to nip in front of his marker and secure victory.
Villa, who had seen Ciaran Clark stab wide from six yards out, sent on Joe Cole and Darren Bent to try to salvage something. Instead, QPR almost netted a third when Vargas was played in behind the Villa defence but fired a tame shot into the legs of Brad Guzan.
Villa's best opportunity came when Green failed to hold on to Tom Cleverley's shot from the edge of the area, but Sandro did just enough to put off Clark at the follow-up.
QPR manager Harry Redknapp: ""Charlie Austin can score goals in any division. A goalscorer is a goalscorer.
""It's a knack and if he gets the chances, he will score goals. Bobby Zamora is a handful too, but there were lots of good performances tonight.

Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert: ""The two goals we conceded were really poor. Two shots on goal and two goals but we have to score.

43,"Daniel Amokachi has been in charge of Nigeria on a temporary basis since December following lengthy contractual talks between Stephen Keshi and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF).
NFF president Amaju Pinnick announced two weeks ago that a two-year deal has been approved for Keshi to continue but a contract is yet to be signed.
We need to resolve this coaching situation quickly to prevent another troubled qualifying race for the Nations Cup
Okocha, who won the Nations Cup in 1994 and was part of the gold-medal winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, believes delays in the contractual process are hampering plans for the qualification campaign for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.
""We need to resolve this coaching situation quickly to prevent another troubled qualifying race for the Nations Cup,"" Okocha told BBC Sport.
""Nigerians want to hear about the team, the plans ahead and not who should or shouldn't be in charge of the team.
""Right now our focus should have shifted towards whoever takes charge of the team to enable us correct the ills of our previous qualifying series.
""We cannot afford to miss out on the next tournament, so we need to get the coach in to start work immediately.""
Keshi initially took charge of the team in November 2011 but his contract ran out after last year's World Cup in Brazil, where Nigeria reached the second round stage.
During his first spell in charge, Keshi won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations but working on a match-by-match agreement he failed to qualify for the recent Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea.
As caretaker coach he endured a turbulent 2014, in which he was sacked by the NFF and only reinstalled after intervention from Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan.
Debate has raged in the country over whether the 53-year-old, who won the Nations Cup as a player with Nigeria in 1994, should be given a new contract.
But Okocha, who is the Delta State FA boss and chairman of the NFF's technical study group, has called for a quick end to the saga, insisting that any delays could further derail the country's football.
""We already know our group opponents for the qualifiers but the players don't know who is in charge, this is something we need to nip in the bud,"" he said.
""I think the sooner the coaching status is finalised would be a big step in the right direction for our country's football.
""The uncertainty and the lack of clarity about the coach is obviously really concerning and worrying for everyone, including players, the local media and fans.""
In one of the toughest-looking 2017 Nations Cup qualifying groups, coachless Nigeria will take on seven-time champions Egypt in Group F alongside Tanzania and Chad.",Former Nigeria captain Jay-Jay Okocha urged the country's football authority to swiftly resolve the national team's managerial vacancy in order to prevent further setbacks.

Global stock markets saw big falls on Monday after the weekend's events.

Existential threat to euro from Greek exit
Earlier, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he felt ""betrayed"" by the ""egotism"" shown by Greece in the failed talks on giving heavily indebted Greece the last payment of its international bailout.
He said Greek proposals were ""delayed"" or ""deliberately altered"" but added the door was still open to talks.
Despite the public war of words, a Greek official said Mr Tsipras had spoken to Mr Juncker on Friday and asked him to extend Greece's bailout until the referendum.
A critical deadline looms on Tuesday, when Greece is due to pay back €1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund - the same day its current bailout expires. There are fears of a default and a possible exit from euro.
Mr Juncker said that he still believed a Greek exit from the euro was not an option and insisted that the creditors' latest proposal meant more social fairness.
The question which will be put to voters on Sunday will not be as simple as whether they want to stay in the euro or not - instead it asks Greeks to approve or reject the specific terms laid out by Greece's creditors:
""Should the agreement plan submitted by the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to the June 25 eurogroup and consisting of two parts, which form their single proposal, be accepted?

On Saturday, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided not to extend emergency finance to the Greek banks, after the breakdown of talks on giving heavily indebted Greece the last payment of its international bailout.
The current ceiling for the ECB's emergency funding - Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) - is €89bn (£63bn). It is thought that virtually all that money has been disbursed.

The 36 matches scrutinised in the investigation span a period from July 2012 to October 2015, though in a statement the AFC said it was ""aware"" of ineligible participation at previous events but was ""unable to retrieve team line-up data for those matches"".
After beating Cambodia 5-1 in 2012, East Timor overcame Laos to finish within a point of making the group stage of the AFF Championship, a tournament contested by the best nations in Southeast Asia.
However, the number of ineligible players used increased in 2015, when as many as seven were used across 10 World Cup qualifying matches where the team picked up two wins.
There is no mention in any of the reports of any player's involvement in falsifying the documents.

""It was unfortunate, it was right at the end of training, the same spot where he had it before.
""He had to have an operation. [He] will be out probably for the next few months.

Midfielder Stuart Armstrong and forward Leigh Griffiths are nearing returns from injury but will not feature against Inverness Caledonian Thistle in Saturday's Scottish Cup fifth-round tie in Glasgow.
Meanwhile, Rodgers says the club are nearing agreement over a new contract for goalkeeper Craig Gordon.
Celtic fended off interest in the 34-year-old from Chelsea during the January transfer window.
""I have spoken to the club and it is very close, just wrapping up one or two details I believe, 99.9% is all agreed,"" added Rodgers.
""It will be great news once that is complete. That is the main signing in the January window as such.
""He is a real pivotal part of how I want to work. I have made it clear since I came in how I wanted to impose my style and the importance of the goalkeeper within that.
""And I look at him now, seven months on from when I came in, and he is a totally different character both in personality, character and his output in the team.

The hospital said it was the biggest donation it had received and said ""thousands of people"" would benefit.
More on this story and others from Suffolk
Mr Gibbons, from Bramford, Suffolk, was ""thrifty"" and sold second-hand cars and trailers, according to his friends Gary and Trisha Walton.
""You heard rumours about his money, but when we found out how much it was we were quite shocked.
""He was a lovable rogue - a bit of a wheeler dealer.
""People who knew him just knew that was the way he was - that was him and he was quite happy,"" said Mrs Walton.
Mr Gibbons always praised the care he received at the hospital and felt the nurses did not get paid enough, Mr Walton said.
The donation means the hospital can renovate four wards, improve the children's ward and use the rest of the money for projects suggested by staff.
Laurence Collins, non-executive director of the Ipswich Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""Thousands of people will be touched every day by Mr Gibbons' kindness when they come into the hospital and see an environment which is completely transformed.

56,"In atrocious conditions, Falcons survived Guy Mercer's early try to open up the lead through Rob Vickers' score and Craig Willis' eight-point haul.
Rhys Priestland kicked Bath back in front but Willis' brace of penalties ensured four precious points.
The win lifts Falcons off the foot of the Premiership.
Bath's tumble down the table after last season's flying run to the Premiership final has been a perplexing one, as they named a strong side with a particularly strong bench for this trip to the north east, but they have failed to find their form this season.
Omens did bode well for Mike Ford's side, who had won their previous 10 visits, but despite an early breakthrough, they struggled to match the intensity shown by the Falcons under the drizzle and wind.
In fact the scoreline might have been greater had Willis not passed up three penalty goal chances in the first half.
Amid the rain and gloomy skies, Mercer rolled over for Bath after a line-out drive to give the visitors an early advantage, but Vickers crossed after strong Falcons pressure to gain the lead.
Henry Thomas was sent to the sin-bin as Bath failed to keep their discipline and Willis' kick gave the hosts a cushion at the break - although it could have been a greater tally had a try not been chalked off by the TMO.
Priestland and Willis then traded penalties in a gritty second period, with the latter coming out on top with two late efforts to lift the Kingston Park crowd.
Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards:
""It's a great start to the year. I thought we deserved the win.
""Okay, we missed a few points, but we came up with the goods and deserved it.
""The boys stuck to their guns and it's probably the first time this season we've done that.
""Now we need to take that into the game at London Irish and build on it.""
Bath head coach Mike Ford:
""Credit to Newcastle - they defended really well but our players really need to have a look at themselves and question whether they were really ready to play.
""It was wet and windy, but then it often is here. We have to look forward but we also have to be truthful and it's all about responsibility and you cannot just expect to turn up and win.
""The players are back in on Tuesday and I expect them to hold up their hands, talk about it and then move on.""

57,"Mr Kerry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai are discussing the deal which would allow the presence of US troops after the 2014 Nato troop withdrawal.
But disagreements remain over key issues, including how much the US would defend Afghanistan if it is attacked.
Mr Karzai has accused Nato of failing to bring stability to Afghanistan.
""On the security front the entire Nato exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains because the country is not secure,"" he told the BBC Newsnight earlier this week.
Mr Kerry began talks with his Afghan counterpart shortly after arriving on an unannounced visit to Kabul on Friday.
Washington wants the deal done before Afghanistan's presidential election campaign opens next month.
""(US) President (Barack) Obama and President Karzai reaffirmed both back in January that the goal here was to complete the BSA (Bilateral Security Agreement) in October,"" a US state department official travelling with Mr Kerry was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.
""Uncertainty about an incomplete BSA could erode the resolve among Nato allies, makes (it) more difficult to plan for the US,"" the official said.
But there is deadlock over how much the US would defend Afghanistan if it is attacked, with Washington not wanting to be committed to defending the mountain passes of the east against infiltration from Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Kabul wants an end to raids on its soil and is demanding that the US hand over intelligence instead.
During his visit Mr Kerry will hope to bridge what looks like a wide gap between the two sides, the BBC's Afghanistan correspondent David Loyn reports.
But he adds that US officials are now talking about the possibility of a ""zero option"" - no troops in Afghanistan after the end of 2014.
Mr Karzai told the BBC's Newsnight this week that he was in no hurry to sign a pact.
""If the agreement doesn't suit us then of course they can leave. The agreement has to suit Afghanistan's interests and purposes. If it doesn't suit us and if it doesn't suit them then naturally we will go separate ways.""
He also claimed that Nato had incorrectly focused the fight on Afghan villages rather than Taliban safe havens in Pakistan.
Mr Karzai has had troubled relations with his Western backers in recent years for openly criticising Nato, whom he has accused of having no respect for Afghan sovereignty.
He is concerned about his legacy, not wanting to be remembered for losing Afghan sovereignty, our correspondent adds.","US Secretary of State John Kerry has begun talks in Afghanistan, which are expected to focus on a stalled security agreement between the two nations."

""The terrible events in Croydon had a massive impact on us,"" he added.
Some Palace supporters were among those who lost their lives and Pardew said the club had contributed to a fund to help the victims of the incident and their families.

""It's a shame,"" McDermott told BBC Sport. ""For us, Saints and the competition, we want the best players.""
He added: ""I've taken the line when they've banned players, it's all well and good but sometimes they're putting bans on the best people in the sport and you want them on the field - although I'm not sure what the answer is there.

61,"Shirley Oaks Survivors Association told the BBC it would recommend withdrawing from the Lambeth strand of the inquiry because it was not ""truly independent"".
Ex-inquiry chair Justice Lowell Goddard has said she was prevented from picking her own staff, and that civil servants were prioritised by the Home Office.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd denied this.
The treatment of children in care in Lambeth, south London, during the second half of the 20th Century is one of 13 areas that the inquiry is looking at.
But the Shirley Oaks group said the Home Office was one of the institutions that had failed children in care in Lambeth in the past - and that the scale of its presence in the inquiry staff represented a conflict of interest.
Raymond Stevenson, from the survivors' group, told BBC Newsnight there had been a sea change in the way the inquiry was operating.
""We have to recommend at this moment in time that we pull out. We have given the inquiry an opportunity to meet us. We contacted them two weeks ago and we are still waiting for a meeting,"" he said.
""Some of our members have been through investigations before which had Home Office members and staff part of it so we have been through that.
""This is about the third investigation Lambeth has been through so what we wanted from this was for it to be truly independent. We were sold a theory it would be truly independent.""
In a written submission to the Commons Home Affairs Committee, Dame Lowell said: ""The panel and I have had little or no input into either the composition of the senior management team or the recruitment of secretariat staff during the lifetime of the current inquiry.
""The administrative arrangements made by the Home Office as the inquiry's sponsor meant that in the recruitment of staff priority was given to civil servants.
""Their approach has been bureaucratic and the inquiry's progress has been impeded by a lack of adequate systems and personnel, leading to critical delays.
""I felt as chair handicapped by not being given a free hand to recruit staff of the type that I judged to be essential.""
Ms Rudd denied that Dame Lowell had been unable to choose her own staff, and has also said the scope of the inquiry will not change despite Dame Lowell's claim it was too big and bureaucratic and should focus on current child protection and future changes.
The inquiry was set up in 2014 and announced that 13 initial investigations would look into allegations against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces, public and private institutions and people in the public eye.
It has been beset by problems, and last month Dame Lowell became the third chair to quit the inquiry.

After Anthony Stokes missed from three yards, he grabbed his sixth goal in Hibs colours this season with a low drive.
Then Martin Boyle thumped a 30-yard screamer into the top corner.
The win allows Hibernian to reduce the gap on second placed Falkirk while Livingston remain in the relegation play-off spot at the bottom.
Hibernian were playing their first home league match since the 3-0 defeat to Morton in late February and the players looked intent in getting back to winning ways with intense early pressure.
John McGinn went on a mazy run and found his way into the 18-yard box, but his shot was brilliantly tipped wide of goal by goalkeeper Marc McCallum.
Jason Cummings was next to try his luck on goal but his shot was just over the crossbar.
The visitors slowly eased their way into the game and shocked the home support when they took the lead midway through the first half.
Osman Kakay, on loan from Queens Park Rangers, had a close range effort blocked by Paul Hanlon, but the rebound fell straight to striker White who sent a stunning volley into the top left hand corner of Mark Oxleys goal.
The 167 away fans that were inside Easter Road were quick to show their team how much they valued the strike.
The goal also led to a chorus of boos ringing around Easter Road as the home fans began to show their frustrations on their teams performance.
Captain David Gray fired just wide when he should have at least tested the keeper, then Liam Henderson and Stokes combined with a set-piece from the training ground, but the on loan Celtic strikers effort was straight at McCallum in the Livi goal.
Another blow came for the home side when El Alagui had to be replaced after suffering a hamstring injury with Jason Keatings his replacement, but Alan Stubbs half-time team talk looked to have ruffled the feathers of his players as the came out of the traps quickly after the break.
They forced four corners in the opening four minutes and it took a goal line clearance from Ben Gordon to deny Stokes an equaliser.
Then an amazing escape for the visitors as Hibs began to pile on the pressure.
Substitute Boyle was only on the pitch for a few minutes when he used his electric pace to take the ball to the bye-line. His cross was met by Stokes on the angle but his glancing effort crept agonisingly along the goal line and was cleared away.
The hosts eventually made the breakthrough when Stokes latched onto a flick by Cummings on the edge of the box and turned before hitting a right foot drive beyond the goalkeeper.
Then Easter Road came to life with with a contender for goal of the season.
The ball fell tantalisingly to Boyle fully 30 yards out and he thundered a shot that was still rising as it hit the roof of the net.
Cummings then had an opportunity to wrap up all three points when sent clear by Keatings, but his effort was straight at McCallum who was able to parry the ball clear.
Hanlon also came close with a header that drifted just wide of goal but the home side were able to see out the game with ease.",Hibernian roared back from behind against Livingston and breathed new life into their Scottish Championship promotion campaign.

65,"The Sutton Trust education charity report says education is the top area of employment for Oxford graduates.
Teach First, which recruits top graduates into teaching, said the profession's status had been raised.
Independent schools are three times more likely to have Oxbridge-educated teachers than state schools,
The report says: ""While there remains a gap between the state and independent sectors, however, there is evidence that this gap has narrowed.
""Since 2003, and extrapolating from the findings of this report, it can be estimated that the state sector has recruited about 6,000 additional secondary teachers from Oxbridge, while recruitment to the independent sector from the same has remained broadly stable.
""Extrapolating these figures for the nation as a whole, it can be said that there are now more Oxbridge-educated graduates in the state sector, than in the independent.
""This suggests that, while there is clearly a long way still to go, there has been progress in realising the goals of consecutive governments to recruit more teachers educated at the nation's best universities into the state school system.""
Teach First founder Greg Wigdortz said: ""Teach First is proud to have played a part in raising the status of the profession, with teaching now being seen as one of the most prestigious careers for the graduates.
""Great teaching and leadership are among the most powerful forces for social change.""
The Sutton Trust stresses a top university degree is not the only factor needed for good teaching, but highlights its own earlier research saying solid subject knowledge is a key quality for able teachers.
It also looks at the subject specialisms held by teachers in the state and independent sectors, and cites Department for Education figures saying 86% of state secondary English, maths and science teachers hold a relevant post-A Level qualification.
Teachers of science and maths in independent schools, however, are slightly more likely to have relevant post-A Level than their state counterparts.
Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: ""Although today's figures show that there has been progress over the past few years, with better qualified teachers and more from Oxbridge, it's vital that we do more to ensure that pupils from low- and middle-income backgrounds are just as likely to access the best teachers as their more advantaged peers.""
Nansi Ellis, assistant general secretary at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the change said more about the state of the economy than the status of the profession.
She added: ""Being an Oxbridge graduate may well give you some good subject knowledge, but it's not the only place for getting a good degree.
""If you are somebody who has gone through the education system without much struggle, that might mean you are less able to explain things well to children who are struggling.""","The number of Oxford and Cambridge graduates teaching in state schools has nearly doubled to 11,000 in the past 12 years, a report says."

Scottish Borders Council leader David Parker said the figures showed the ""transformational impact"" of the railway.
""To see five times the number of passengers expected using Galashiels railway station in the first six months of operation is remarkable, but for Tweedbank to have been used by almost 184,000 passengers in just six months is beyond our wildest expectations,"" he said.
""I am delighted that Stow station has also seen use well above that projected prior to the opening of the Borders Railway and that over 200,000 people have used the line to travel from Edinburgh.
""This justifies all the hard work, over many years, to bring about the return of the railway to the central Borders, and gives us a fantastic challenge to make the very most of this unique opportunity for the Scottish Borders.
""It also shows how important it is to look seriously at the potential extension of the line to Hawick and beyond.""

Speaking to his own charitable foundation's Facebook page, Gregg revealed that he had been contacted by a grieving Brazilian journalist following following Monday's tragedy in Colombia which killed 71 people including 19 players from the Chapecoense club on the way to play in the final of one of South America's major competitions.
""At Munich, I lost my friends and fellow players but there were others on board including one of the country's greatest journalists at the time,"" added Gregg.

""When I told this Brazilian man this he said to me, 'Harry Gregg, I am so glad that you remembered everyone who died on the plane because I lost three friends on that aircraft who were sports journalists'.
""As with Munich the focus might be on the lost players but I told him we should never forget the others who died. I hope that gave this Brazilian journalist some comfort, as he was grieving too.""
Gregg stayed with the burning plane in Munich after the air crash and helped to rescue a number of people, including a mother and baby.
Six people - including three players - survived Monday's crash close to the Colombian city of Medellin although goalkeeper Jackson Follmann's right leg has had to be amputated.
Gregg says getting back on to the training field following the accident ""stopped me from going insane over what had happened to us all"".

70,"Mrs Foster will replace Peter Robinson, who announced his plans to step down as DUP leader and Northern Ireland first minister last month.
She is the only candidate for leader.
Replacing Mr Robinson became more of a coronation than an election when DUP MPs Nigel Dodds and Sammy Wilson said they would not put their names forward.
Nevertheless, the party's 46 most senior representatives at Stormont, Westminster and the European Parliament will gather at an east Belfast hotel on Thursday, to go through the formality of electing their sole nominee.
Later in the evening, the DUP's 90-member executive will then be asked to ratify her appointment.
Arlene Foster has experience of some of the most high-profile posts in Northern Ireland politics and has long been tipped for Stormont's top job.
The Fermanagh politician  has had a rapid rise through the DUP ranks since joining the party from the Ulster Unionists in 2004.
She was born Arlene Kelly in Roslea in 1970.
Her first experience of Troubles violence came when she was just eight years old.
Her father was a part-time policeman and was shot by the IRA at the family farm.
When she was a teenager in 1988, a bomb exploded under her school bus.
Profile of Arlene Foster
Mrs Foster has represented the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency since 2003.
She is Stormont's current finance minister and has twice held the role of acting first minister of Northern Ireland, when Mr Robinson stepped aside temporarily in 2010 and in September this year.
Mrs Foster recently said she has been humbled by the level of support she has received from her party.
Although she is set to lead the DUP from Thursday onwards, she will not take over from Mr Robinson as first minister until 11 January - the day MLAs return to their debating chamber after the winter break.",Senior Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politicians are set to formally elect Arlene Foster as their first female party leader on Thursday evening.
71,"Ellen Higginbottom's body was found at Orrell Water Park, Wigan early on Saturday - a Wigan man, 47, and a man, 51, from Preston are being questioned.
Post-mortem tests found Ellen, who was reported missing on Friday, died due to ""multiple wounds to the neck"".
Louise Tipping - principal at Winstanley College, where she studied - said: ""Ellen was absolutely wonderful.""
She added: ""Her contribution to our college was fantastic.""
Ms Tipping said she had received many emails over the weekend from students asking how the college would pay tribute to the girl who was a student ambassador at the college.
She added: ""Ellen was much loved. She was one of those people who lit up the room. She was a lovely, lovely girl.""
Ellen was reported missing after failing to return from college.
Friends said she was last seen in the Orrell Water Park area.
Police found her body at about 02:30 BST on Saturday during a search.
A 47-year-old man from Billinge, Wigan was arrested followed by a second man who was arrested at an address in Preston.
Police said his address was being searched and there was a large police presence in the area.
Det Supt Howard Millington from Greater Manchester Police said: ""It is unimaginable what Ellen's family and friends must be going through right now and my thoughts continue to be with them throughout all of this.
He added: ""Whilst we have now made two arrests, our investigation continues as we piece together the puzzle to find out what exactly happened to Ellen on Friday and give her family the answers they deserve.""

72,"The exhibition of popular music opened at the O2 in Greenwich in 2009 but closed last year amid plans to relocate.
Plans have now been announced to move the museum to Liverpool's Cunard building and to open at Easter 2016.
The museum features hundreds of rare artefacts and manuscripts.
Among them are David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust costumes and the original handwritten lyrics to Blue Monday by New Order.
Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said: ""It makes perfect sense that a museum which celebrates the importance of British music and its influence on society has its home in Liverpool.
""Music is entwined with the city's history, present and future. The Cunard building itself played a vital role in shaping the industry thanks to the music that travelled across the Atlantic by those travelling on the Cunard vessels.
""This music then immersed itself in our culture and influenced many aspiring musicians, including four young men who went on to become the most famous band in the world.""
The museum, which operates as a registered charity and is managed by a trust, is being partially funded by a Â£2.6m Regional Growth Fund grant from the government.
It will feature a new cafe and shop selling souvenirs and collector's items.
Museum chairman Harvey Goldsmith said: ""The trustees of the British Music Experience are thrilled to have partnered with the city of Liverpool and to have found a permanent home for the UK's collection of rock and pop memorabilia and artefacts.""
At the time of the museum's closing in London, Mr Goldsmith said the trust was looking for a ""more sustainable home"" for the attraction.","Liverpool is to become the new permanent home of the British Music Experience museum, which is leaving its current home in London."

75,"Claudia Winkleman was the highest-paid female celebrity, earning between £450,000 and £500,000 last year, its annual report for 2016/2017 says.
The One Show's Alex Jones was second, earning between £400,000 and £450,000.
BBC director general Tony Hall said there was ""more to do"" on the gender pay gap.
The top seven earners, in the list of the BBC's 96 best-paid stars, were all male.
It is the first time the pay of stars earning more than £150,000 has been made public.
The BBC has been compelled to reveal the information under the terms of its new Royal Charter.
Speaking on LBC Radio, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We've seen the way the BBC is paying women less for doing the same job... I want women to be paid equally.""
When asked if Evans was worth considerably more than her, she said: ""What's important is that the BBC looks at the question of paying men and women the same for doing the same job.""
The total bill for the 96 personalities was £28.7m but the figures in the report reveal large disparities between what men and women are paid.
""On gender and diversity, the BBC is more diverse than the broadcasting industry and the civil service,"" Lord Hall said.
""We've made progress, but we recognise there is more to do and we are pushing further and faster than any other broadcaster.""
When asked if female stars working at the BBC would now be asking for pay rises, Lord Hall said: ""We will be working carefully on our relationship with our talent.""
He also pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020.
Trade union Equity said in a statement: ""The apparent pay gaps in gender and for those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background are troubling.""
Woman's Hour's Jane Garvey tweeted: ""I'm looking forward to presenting @BBCWomansHour today. We'll be discussing #GenderPayGap . As we've done since 1946. Going well, isn't it?""
Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis retweeted Garvey's message.
Other high profile omissions including the Today programme's Sarah Montague, BBC Breakfast's Louise Minchin and Woman's Hour's Jenni Murray.
Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys, acknowledged that his £600,000 salary was hard to justify: ""On paper, absolutely nothing that justifies that huge amount of money, if you compare me with lots of other people who do visibly.
""If a doctor saves a child's life, if a nurse comforts a dying person, a fireman rushes into Grenfell Tower, then of course you could argue that compared with that sort of thing I'm not worth tuppence ha'penny.  However, we operate in a market place.""
There is also a gap between the pay for white stars and those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background.
George Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson are the highest paid BAME presenters, each receiving between £250,000 and £300,000.
The highest-paid female star with a BAME background is BBC news presenter Mishal Husain, who earned between £200,000 and £250,000.
The annual report does not include stars who receive their pay through BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm.
The figures quoted only refer to the amount of licence fee money each person receives and do not include their earnings from other broadcasters or commercial activities. They also exclude stars paid through independent production companies.
That means some big name stars - such as David Attenborough, Benedict Cumberbatch and Matt LeBlanc - do not appear on the list.
The list also does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are just paid for one. Talent pay is considerably higher in the commercial sector.
As he left the BBC after his Radio 2 breakfast show on Wednesday, Chris Evans said it was right ""on balance"" that star salaries were being disclosed.
""We are the ultimate public company I think, and therefore it's probably right and proper people know what we get paid,"" he told reporters.
During a briefing on the annual report on Wednesday morning, Lord Hall said: ""Chris Evans is presenting the most popular show on the most popular radio network in Europe.
""The BBC does not exist in a market on its own where it can set the market rates.
""If we are to give the public what they want, then we have to pay for those great presenters and stars.""
Aside from Strictly, Winkleman's other BBC roles include presenting The Great British Sewing Bee and her Radio 2 Sunday night show. Her agent said she would be making no comment.
Casualty star Derek Thompson was the BBC's highest paid actor, receiving between £350,000 and £400,000 over the last financial year.
Amanda Mealing, who also stars in Casualty as well as Holby City, was the highest paid actress, receiving between £250,000 and £300,000.
Clare Balding earned between £150,000 and £200,000 for her work on sports shows including Wimbledon Today and the Rio Olympics.

A spokesman for the Heritage Lottery and Big lottery funds said it would allow the parks, many of them in some of the UK's most deprived communities, to be ""transformed"".
They include £4.5m for Hanley Park in Stoke-on-Trent.
One of the biggest Victorian parks in the UK, it was built for local miners to relax and play sports.
Stoke-on-Trent City Council said the money would be used to restore a 19th Century pavilion, and make improvements to the boathouse, canal bridges, the lake and fountains, as well as revamp green spaces on the 60-acre site.
Work is expected to start in spring 2016 and take 18 months to complete.
It is one of the biggest grants from the two lottery funds.
Some of the projects, including Springfield Park in Hackney, Great Yarmouth Venetian Waterways and West Smethwick Park in Sandwell have been allocated funding, but need to go through a second round to confirm.
The largest single grant, worth £4.8m went to West Smethwick Park, with plans to build a new pavilion and restore historical features, such as the bandstand and memorials.
In Yarmouth, a £1m grant will go towards the restoration of the Venetian-style water gardens, including bringing back much of the original planting and regenerating the waterways themselves, which the HLF said had deteriorated since the 1980s.
Sir Peter Luff, chair of the Heritage Lottery Fundl, said it was ""vital"" to protect the country's green spaces, particularly those in towns and cities.

77,"The ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free) sign was stolen by a gang of Polish thieves acting at the behest of a Swedish far-right-winger.
Technicians unveiled the restored sign in the laboratory of the camp museum.
More than one million people, mostly Jews from across Europe, were murdered by the Nazis at the camp.
Most of the work to restore the damaged sign was done on site, but a master blacksmith welded it back together.
The museum's director, Piotr Cywinski, said the sign would probably form part of a new exhibition.
A copy of the original has been placed above the entrance gate.
Thieves had cut up the black wrought-iron sign into its three constituent words in order to fit it into their getaway car after taking it down from the main gate.
Following a nationwide search, police found the sign a few days later in a rural area hundreds of kilometres away.

A dispute between loyalist factions in the town has been ongoing for months.
Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray said a link to the south-east Antrim element of the UDA, is a ""very strong"" line of inquiry.
""At least one of the bullets that was fired at the victim missed and went through the front door of the house and could well have hit an occupant,"" he said.
He rejected any suggestion that the police have lost any control in dealing with the on-going paramilitary feuds in the County Antrim town, but added: ""We need people to come forward and give us evidence.""
Det Ch Supt Murray said police believe there were potentially two gunmen involved in Monday's attack.
He said they may have come from an alleyway near Pinewood Avenue in Carrickfergus to carry out the attack, may have made off on foot and may have been wearing dark clothing.
Police have described the murder as a ""ruthless attack in broad daylight"" and have appealed for help in indentifying those involved.
Det Ch Supt Murray said: ""Our thoughts are with the Gilmore family at this time as they come to terms with their loss.
""Those involved had no consideration for the local community when they carried out their attack in a residential street populated with families, young children and older people.""
Earlier, Democratic Unionist Party MP Sammy Wilson said the feud involved two factions of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) paramilitary group.
""One side, in broad daylight and unmasked, have taken the opportunity to try to kill one of the Gilmore family,"" he added.

84,"It has the potential to revolutionise treatment for one of the biggest killers in the world, says the team at the University of Oxford.
It works by analysing the fat and inflammation around arteries to see which are a ticking time bomb.
And it could allow high-risk patients to be given more intensive treatment to avoid a heart attack or stroke.
The researchers were looking at the role of inflammation in heart disease.
Inflammation is that red, swollen and sore feeling you get after a cut - but the same process plays out in all the tissues in the body.
On the inside of your blood vessels, inflammation is linked to the build-up of unstable plaques. These can break apart, block a coronary artery and starve the heart of oxygen - namely a heart attack.
""The holy grail in cardiology is the ability to pick up inflammation in coronary arteries, it's been a challenge for the past 50 years,"" said Prof Charalambos Antoniades, one of the researchers.
The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, shows inflammation changes the behaviour of fat around the outside of blood vessels.
When there is inflammation, the fat starts to break down and the surrounding tissue becomes more watery.
This can be picked up by analysing CT scans, which are already a part of heart health exams.
The redder the tissue appears, the greater the level of inflammation and the greater danger.
This study is just the appetizer - it showed the changes can be detected in people who are already having cardiac surgery.
The main course should arrive by the end of the year. The team is going over 2,000 heart scans to see how good their method is at predicting heart attacks in people who appear healthy.
Prof Antoniades told the BBC News website: ""This technology may predict who will have a heart attack in the future.
""It means you could go to your GP, change your prescription and prevent it before it happens.""
For example, it could show somebody who appears healthy is in the early stages of heart disease and needs cholesterol-lowering statins.
Or somebody could be at seriously high risk and needs more drastic interventions.
Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Discovering which plaques are likely to rupture, so people can be treated before such a devastating event strikes, is a major objective of current research.
""If the technique lives up to its promise in larger trials in patients, it could lead to more effective treatment to avoid a potentially fatal heart attack or stroke.""",Scientists have developed a new way of scanning the heart that could predict who will have a heart attack.
85,"Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said that the community and the police had a ""fractured"" relationship.
A 25-year-old black man, Freddie Gray, suffered fatal injuries when arrested, sparking protests and riots.
The US Department of Justice is already investigating whether Mr Gray's civil rights were violated in the incident.
Ms Rawlings-Blake said the US attorney general understands the urgency of her request for an investigation.
The request comes a day after the new head of the justice department, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, visited the city.
A spokeswoman for the US Department of Justice - who would handle the request - acknowledged receipt of the request for a ""pattern or practice"" investigation.
""The attorney general is actively considering that option in light of what she heard from law enforcement, city officials, and community, faith and youth leaders in Baltimore yesterday,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said.
Baltimore City Council President Jack Young has been calling for this kind of investigation since October - well before Mr Gray's arrest and death in April - said his spokesman.
The new investigation that is being called for is similar to the one that was done in Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer last summer.
The wide-ranging investigations look for patterns of discrimination within the police departments being reviewed. They can involve the examination of how officers search and arrest suspects, and how they use force against them.
The investigation's results can sometimes include an agreement known as a consent decree, in which the police department in question agrees to make specific changes, while an outside monitor is appointed to ensure compliance.
The US Justice Department seems to be stepping up its reviews of police departments around the country.
In the first five years of the Obama administration, the US Justice Department began investigations into more than 20 police departments around the country - that's more than double the amount in the five-year period before that.
The vast majority of police agencies that are reviewed and found to be in violation of the US constitution voluntarily agree to implement reforms, the Justice Department says. However, when they do not agree, the department can file lawsuits to force an overhaul.
Investigations do not always find abuse. Investigators in the most recent five-year period have reviewed five law enforcement agencies without finding constitutional violations.
For more: Four other US police forces under scrutiny
The US Justice Department formed this kind of agreement with the New Orleans Police Department in 2012, and the police force there was required to make widespread reforms.

Oakmont, last used for this tournament when Angel Cabrera won in 2007, when five-over par was the winning score, is a typically brutal US Open course, a 7,219-yard par-70 set-up with 210 bunkers and a 288-yard par three.
McIlroy believes repeating his success in 2011, when he took advantage of a rain-softened course at Congressional to win with a record 16-under-par total, would rank among his career highs.

89,"A former military ruler known for his no-nonsense style would appear to have little in common with a reality TV show where contestants engage in attention-seeking behaviour.
But both subjects were soon generating headlines for the same reason - neither of them were in Nigeria.
It turned out that Big Brother was actually being filmed in South Africa  - a decision that led Nigeria's information minister to launch an investigation.
While the howls of protests from outraged Big Brother fans soon died down, the clamour over Nigeria's leader's extended medical stay in London is not going away.
President Buhari's absence comes as Africa's most populous nation is gripped by its worst economic crisis in decades, and faces the threat of famine in north-east Nigeria, which has been devastated by the Boko Haram insurgency.
And unlike Big Brother, there are no constant updates - in fact, President Buhari, 74, has not given a single interview since arriving in the UK.
Instead, the Nigerian public is relying on pictures - posted on Twitter - of their leader meeting senior UK officials as proof that he still is alive.
The latest statement issued by the government said there was ""no cause for worry"" about the president's health but his medical leave was being extended.
His month-long stay so far has angered some Nigerians after he promised to crackdown on ""medical tourism"" by officials last year.
Last June, President Buhari spent nearly two weeks in London receiving treatment for an ear infection.
But the bigger issue this time is that officials have repeatedly refused to disclose his illness and are not saying when he will return to Nigeria.
In a country where rumours are rife, the presidential statements have done little to dampen the speculation about the leader's health.
Nigerians are acutely sensitive to leaders travelling abroad for medical reasons after President Umaru Yar'Adua died while in office in 2010.
For months, the public was kept in the dark while he received treatment in Saudi Arabia.
The period of uncertainty created deep political instability in the country.
The current president's supporters say that is emphatically not the case this time.
They point to the fact that President Buhari constitutionally handed over power to his vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, as he has done on previous trips, rather than governing from afar.
He did take one phone call while in London, however, from the US President Donald Trump - the first between the two leaders.
""There is no vacuum at the top,"" says political analyst Jibrin Ibrahim.
""President Buhari takes his constitutional role seriously, and has not personalised power, unlike other African leaders.
""My chief criticism is that his government has been acting like it has all the time in the world, when in fact urgent decisions needed to be made in regard to the economy.""
But, perhaps, one of the most striking things about President Buhari's absence has been the go-getting style of the acting leader.
Yemi Osinbajo is preparing to launch an economic recovery plan.
He also led a high-profile delegation to the Niger Delta to voice support for a government agreement with local militants groups that have seriously disrupted the region's oil production.
But critics say that despite all his activity, the vice-president has no real authority.
""He cannot perform because ministers and other political appointments are not obliged to be loyal to him as he didn't appoint them,"" said Isuwa Dogo, a political analyst, and a member of the opposition party.
""President Buhari is a public figure and there is no need for him to hide behind his health issues.
""I want him to be back in the county. If there are successes, he will get the credit. If there are failures, he will get the blame.""
So, while Big Brother fans will know in April who has been crowned the series winner, for now, no-one seems to know when Nigeria's president will come back home.","As Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was beginning his latest visit to London more than a month ago, a new series of Big Brother Nigeria was getting under way."
90,"Several members of her group suffered from mild hypothermia after conditions deteriorated near Slieve Beg on Monday.
The team was made up of 11 students from two Dungannon schools, the Royal and St Patrick's Academy.
The girl who became ill on the mountain was from the Royal School.
Members of her group contacted the emergency services and the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team was called to the scene at about 19:15 BST.
Martin McMullan from the rescue service said all 11 group members, aged 16 and 17, were quickly found and treated.
He said they were ""all doing well"" and the girl who suffered severe hypothermia has now returned home.
The rescue team doctor and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service were involved in the rescue.
Mr McMullan said the teenagers' quick thinking and help for each other prevented a more serious situation.
""When you're in the mountains, the conditions are a part of it [and] you're working a little bit harder, you're carrying a rucksack on your back,"" he said.
""There are a lot of different factors that do take their toll on individuals.
""The one thing about these guys last night is they did a phenomenal job looking after each other.
""If they hadn't behaved in the way they did in terms of getting their entire group into shelter and calling for help, the situation could have been much, much worse.""
Twenty-three rescuers took part in the operation that ended at 01:10 BST.
""It was a reasonably inaccessible location so we did have a big response last night,"" Mr McMullan said.
""When you get to the stage where you may have to stretcher someone out of the mountain, that requires 12 people in itself.""
Dr David Burnett, principal of Royal School Dungannon, said the young people had done a ""brilliant job"" when they realised one of the party was in distress.
""Seven of the group were able to walk down the mountain with a guide,"" he said.
""The others stayed behind with the girl who had fallen ill.""
""They weren't casualties but stayed behind with her in the tent until help arrived. The pupil who took ill was stretchered down, and then checked by paramedics.
""She did not need hospital treatment, but was reunited with her mother who subsequently took her home.""
""Having spoken to her family this morning, she is doing well and making a good recovery at home.""
Dr Burnett also said that the other ten pupils in the group had returned to the Mournes on Tuesday morning to complete their expedition, which is due to finish later.
Two other joint groups from the schools also spent the night in the Mournes and were unaware of the incident involving their fellow pupils.",A Dungannon schoolgirl suffered severe hypothermia and lost consciousness during a Duke of Edinburgh expedition in the Mourne mountains in County Down.
91,"The Severn Valley Railway (SVR) plans to construct a new station building in Bridgnorth and restore the existing 1862 building.
Last month SVR completed a £250,000 refurbishment of the track between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth, including Bewdley Tunnel.
The plans for Bridgnorth also include a new information and exhibition area.
Nick Ralls, general manager of SVR, said: ""Most of our passengers begin their journey in Kidderminster and head north to Bridgnorth. We want a fitting destination for them to arrive at.""
He added that the station, which reopened in 1970, had not been designed to cope with the line's 250,000 visitors a year.
Mr Ralls said he also hoped to open up Bridgnorth's steam works, where volunteer staff repaired historic steam engines, for other heritage lines across the country.
SVR also plans to build new facilities for its volunteers, including accommodation, showers and a kitchen.
Artist's impressions for the £2m revamp are expected to be ready by April and the initial work could be completed by 2015, he added.
The proposals are part of a 10-year project to bring the line and its stations up to date.",A heritage railway line has announced plans for a £2m revamp of a Shropshire station.
92,"Kate Hardcastle has achieved many things in her life but could she be the person to propel Bradford Bulls into the future?
A little under a year ago, the four-time Super League champions were on the brink of extinction and were forced to appeal to fans to raise £1m to keep the club afloat.
In June they went into administration and were hanging on to their future in the Super League.
A life-long fan, Hardcastle admits that she thought her team might cease to exist.
She says: ""I rushed my daughter there last year, actually thinking 'my goodness me, I've got to take her because this genuinely might be it, this might be the end' - and that filled me with dread.""
Hardcastle explains that she was first taken to Odsal as a two-year-old, by her father, Martin, and her grandfather.
""I was taken in at half time because it was free then so there was no concern that if I didn't enjoy it they would have wasted the money,"" she says.
""But I did enjoy it. I loved the buzz of it.""
And so her love affair with the club began - a love which has seen her step in to become a non-executive director on the board, alongside owner Omar Khan, who bought the club in August to secure its future.
She says her father will be keeping a close eye on the job she is doing.
""He said ""don't mess it up"","" she says.
""I have got a guy, with Bradford Bulls running through him, who will be sat with me at Sunday dinner poking me saying 'right what are you doing next? What are you going to do about this?'
""I get emails at three o clock in the morning from him. I'm like 'dad for goodness sake, we are going as fast as we can'.""
Hardcastle, 36, was the lead singer in a successful band The Fabulous BB Kings, and still sings semi-professionally. She has her own company - ""Insight with Passion"" - which helps revive businesses and she has also set-up Charity Dreamgirls, which helps promote smaller charities across the UK. This woman of many talents has also recently been named Tesco Mum of the Year for 2013.
She explains her main roles at Bradford Bulls will include looking at the branding of the club, attracting more families and appealing to women to get involved in the sport.
She says: ""I am trying to understand what the future of rugby league actually is and it's about inclusivity for me.
""We have a 40% female fan base, the biggest in the Super League, so I thought there was huge potential to understand how we could get more female fans, and make sure that the female fans we have are enjoying it.
""We want to make sure that all of the fans understand the brand and are getting excited about the brand again and that we were taking that message through to grassroots, because those are the children who are going to be the fans of the future.""
A BBC Inside Out report in January revealed that Super League clubs are facing combined debts of £68.5m, and - like the Bulls - Salford City Reds were battling financial problems until they were bought out on the eve of the new season.
But is this a sport which can be saved?
She says: ""It's only going to happen if it understands that the future is about evolution.
""It's got to understand that the future isn't just about doing what we've always done, and cross our fingers and tighten our belts a bit and it's going to be OK.
""And I think the Bradford Bulls are starting to show some indication and some signs that that's going to be the case.""
She explains some of her ideas to bring about her vision of a real family day out to see the Bulls - something which she has seen is possible whilst working in Australia and attending cricket matches and rugby matches in the country.
She says the club will offer childcare facilities on match days so families with young children can still attend the game, she will look at food options (""not just Bovril and a pie"") and she has already asked the fans about what merchandise they would like to see available.
On the subject of evolution, Hardcastle says that it is ""crazy"" that she is the only woman on a Super League board.
""Karren Brady is on the same speaking circuit as me, we both do seminars and speeches, and it was actually very different for her.
""I find the comparison quite challenging sometimes because she was brought in at a very young age to a football club, without having gone and proven herself as a business person and then went on to prove herself brilliantly. I have gone out and been a business woman and I'm being brought in to help a board with my expertise.
""So what the comparison basically is, is that we are business women in sport and that's really sad actually because that's about as far as it goes. I think that just proves there are not enough women in there and we've got to make a change there. ""
She says: ""If those teams are going to start to attract a different audience - and women are a fantastic audience to attract because they are not necessarily being appealed to through the other sports as well - then you need to understand women.
""You need that balance on the board.
""The right person has to do the job, regardless of sex, but if women never actually get the chance to get through, because something is deemed to be male dominated or a man's job, how are you going to be able to prove that you are the right person to do the job anyway?""
Although Hardcastle is not the first woman to grace a Super League boardroom - Kath Hetherington was chairperson of Hull FC for 12 years between 1999 and 2011 - she knows it will be a challenge.
""The fans have been very supportive in the main so far, as have the players and of course the board,"" she says.
""I imagine, if you go digging for it, there would be the odd comment on a forum or whatever about the fact that I'm a woman or the fact that I look a certain way - I don't know.
""No one is going to push me out of this sport.
""It's been my sport since I was two so I will be delivering on my job and when I feel I've succeeded at that job, and I've had the time to do that, then we can have a discussion about how I've got on.""","Award-winning business woman, founder of a charity, semi-professional singer, guest speaker, ""mum of the year"" to a three-year-old daughter - and now the only female director in the Super League."
93,"Wiltshire Police said the blaze at a house in Swindon on Sunday night was a ""tragic accident"" and the death is not being treated as suspicious.
The cause of the fire is still being determined by fire investigators.
Two adults and a 16-month-old baby are still in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
Emergency crews were called just before midnight to the terraced house in Manchester Road.
A boy aged 13 and a 23-year-old woman were also injured in the fire but were not thought to be in a critical condition.",A 30-year-old woman seriously injured in a severe house fire has died in hospital.
94,"He chose to have the lower part of his right leg amputated and was fitted with an artificial limb.
Ben was born with a condition known as fibular hemimelia - giving him a foot with only three toes and a leg that failed to develop.
It left him struggling to walk and frequently in pain.
Ben was fitted with an artificial leg after his amputation - which he says was fine for walking around school, but which did not match his sporting ambitions.
Frustratingly for a boy already keen on sport in primary school, he could not keep up with his friends.
However, his prosthetist Clare Johnson recommended him to become one of the first children to be fitted with a false leg designed specifically for sport by the NHS - and now his sights are set on competing at a future Paralympics.
Ben, now 13, says: ""It has turned out really well. All my PE teachers like it that I've got a prosthetic leg and that I'm still doing sport. They say I have a lot of grit and zest!""
He was fitted with his new blade just before Christmas and switches between that and his other prosthetic leg depending on what he is doing.
""Ben has been empowered by his blade,"" says Clare. ""We hope it will give him a level playing field so he can compete with his peers and participate in more sports with a lighter prosthetic.""
Clare adds that although she was able to make an attachment for Ben's disordered right leg as he was growing up, it was not possible to include the sort of components that could give him a spring in his step.
After three weeks practising with the blade, Ben returned to Clare's treatment room at Brighton General Hospital and tried jogging, running and playing indoor tennis.
He has also just taken on his able-bodied cousin in a straight race and won.
""The blade feels good,"" says Ben. ""The spring of it is the bit that makes me go faster.""
""I wanted the blade to do more running, so I didn't have to stick with cricket and stuff like that to do with upper body. I wanted to do more things with my lower body, run faster and get a bit more speed in football.""
There are about 1,500 children in England who have lost all or part of a limb and 1,100 of them either lack a leg or have one which does not work properly.
It is the first time the NHS has fitted some of them - in Brighton, North Cumbria and Luton - with false legs especially designed for sport.
While Ben has his blade, a child from Cumbria has been given a water limb called a ""swim fin"" which will make swimming with friends possible.
The Â£1.5m programme is intended to help what the NHS says will be ""several hundred"" children each year.
The cost of a blade, together with the follow-up training and assessment, is estimated at around Â£1,000, but it could be several times that amount in the private sector.
Clare says that by preserving the health of the children who get prostheses, the scheme could actually save money.
She says it also supports the health service's campaign to encourage healthy lifestyles among children.
""I don't like the idea that there are a lot of obese children and couch potatoes. I like to think that I have given (Ben) the blade and that he will show to other children that if he can do it, then everyone can do it.  Sport is for everyone, not just a small elite.""
Ben's mother Kathleen is proud of her son's determination to play different sports, which have also included touch rugby.
""He's been up against it,"" she says, ""but despite everything he fought back and he's a little fighter to this day. Now he's got the blade, the sky's the limit.""

95,"Somerset, already with a home tie in the last eight, made just 250-9 despite an opening stand of 108 between Mahela Jayawardene (55) and Jim Allenby (69).
But Hampshire lost regular wickets in the chase as they were all out for 245.
With Middlesex or Surrey set to pick up points in their match at Lord's and Kent beating Sussex, Hampshire can now only finish fifth at best.
Meanwhile, Somerset only lost one match in eight in the group stages and face Worcestershire at Taunton in the quarter-finals.

96,"Omar Mateen told his bosses at G4S he responded by making up stories that he had connections to terror suspects.
The FBI investigated his remarks but determined he did not pose a threat, the documents show.
Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 more before being shot dead by police.
He pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State group during a call to police shortly before the attack on 12 June and the group later described him as one of its fighters.
FBI agents questioned Mateen twice in 2013 following comments he made to colleagues that he had links to the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing and also to Nidal Hasan, a former US Army major sentenced to death for the murders of 13 people at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009.
The records released by the St Lucie County Sheriff's Office in Florida show that Mateen complained of being repeatedly taunted for being a Muslim while working as a security guard at the local courthouse.
He said a fellow guard had teased him, saying: ""We have to be careful - Omar may send us a bomb and he will get his 72 virgins.""
Mateen said that on another occasion a deputy told him he had pork oil on his fingers and he was going to rub them on Mateen's shirt. Muslims consider pork unclean.
According to the documents, Mateen told his employers he had responded to the taunting by making up the stories about ties to people in terror cases.
In a letter to his bosses at private contractor G4S he wrote: ""I love the United States. The boasting, I did it just to satisfy the gang of co-workers who ganged up against me. I'm 1,000% pure American. I'm against these terrorists, any one of them.""
Mateen was questioned by the FBI again in 2014 about a potential connection to Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, the American known to have carried out a suicide bombing in the Syria conflict.
The investigation found no ""substantial relationship"" between Mateen and Abu-Salha and the case was closed, the FBI said.

106,"A spokeswoman for the Post Office told the BBC that the problem began on Sunday and had affected about 100,000 of its customers.
Talk Talk also confirmed that some of its customers had been affected, and it was working on a fix.
It is not yet known who is responsible for the attack.
Earlier in the week, Germany's Deutsche Telekom revealed that up to 900,000 of its customers had lost their internet connection as a result of the attack.
It involves the use of a modified form of the Mirai worm - a type of malware that is spread via hijacked computers, which causes damage to equipment powered by Linux-based operating systems.
Mirai was also involved in an earlier attack that caused several of the world's leading websites to become inaccessible, including Spotify, Twitter and Reddit.
Several models of router are vulnerable to the latest cyber-assault, including the Zyxel AMG1302, which is used by the Post Office.
""We would like to reassure customers that no personal data or devices have been compromised,"" said the Post Office's spokeswoman.
""We have identified the source of the problem and implemented a resolution which is currently being rolled out to all customers.
""For those customers who are still having problems, we are advising them to reboot their router.""
Doing so causes the machine to make use of updated software.
The same router is also used by Kcom, an internet service provider (ISP) based in Hull, whose customers have also been affected.
""The vast majority of our customers are now able to connect to and use their broadband service as usual,"" the firm said in a statement.
""Our core network was not affected at any time and we have put in place measures to block future attacks from impacting our customers' routers and their ability to access the internet.""
TalkTalk also confirmed that its D-Link DSL-3780 routers were affected but said only a small percentage of its customers used them.
""Along with other ISPs in the UK and abroad, we are taking steps to review the potential impacts of the Mirai worm,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement.
""We have deployed additional network-level controls to further protect our customers.""
Security researchers had previously suggested that the routers were vulnerable to the Mirai malware.
One expert warned there could be worse to come.
""The next step for attackers could be to hack into other home devices once they gain access to the router, like web cams, smart TVs, or thermostats,"" said Pavel Sramek from the cybersecurity firm Avast.",Thousands of TalkTalk and Post Office customers have had their internet access cut by an attack targeting certain types of internet routers.
107,"There are 90 seats to be filled, a reduction from the 108 seats elected in May 2016.
With STV, candidates are elected according to the share of the vote they receive, the size of the electorate, and the number of seats to be filled.
On ballot papers, voters rank candidates in order of preference, giving each a number. They can choose as many or as few as they like.
When polls close and vote counting begins, the first step is to work out the 'quota', which decides how many votes a candidate needs to be elected.
To calculate the quota, you divide the number of valid voting papers cast by the number of seats to be filled plus one, and then add one.
Candidates who exceed the quota are elected straight away.
Votes are then redistributed among the other candidates in two ways.
1. Some candidates may be elected by many more votes than the quota. These extra votes are called the surplus, and are redistributed in proportion to the total number of preferences for other candidates in an elected candidate's ballots.
2. The lowest ranked candidates are eliminated, and the preferences on their ballot papers are distributed among the other candidates.
The process continues, with votes redistributed in these two ways, until all the seats are filled.
To illustrate how the process can work, consider an election for the three most popular Shakespeare characters.
Here is the result from the first round of voting:
To calculate the quota: There were 109,525 valid votes cast and three seats to be filled.
So, 109,525 divided by (3 seats +1)4, +1 = 27,382
Hamlet has clearly achieved this, so is elected in round one.
There are 29,406 surplus votes from Hamlet to be redistributed - and all of his ballots are examined to decide the proportion.
Some 23% of Hamlet's total ballots were found to have second preferences for Cleopatra.
Therefore, of the 29,406 surplus, 23% is awarded to Cleopatra = 6,763.4
Quota: 27,382
Cleopatra now exceeds the quota and is elected at stage 2.
The other candidates receive proportional transfers from Hamlet's surplus.
There are 6,148 surplus ballots from her new total to redistribute. Again, all of her ballot papers are examined and the new surplus is redistributed in the same way as before.
Quota: 27,382
However, no one reaches the quota in stage 3 so the last placed candidate - Lady Macbeth - is eliminated.
Any preferences on her ballots are transferred to the remaining candidates.
Any votes with only one preference - for Lady Macbeth herself - are discarded, and known as 'non-transferable'.
Quota: 27,382
Stage 4 concludes with no candidate surpassing the quota.
Last-placed Romeo is now eliminated and his preferences transferred to the remaining candidates.
Quota: 27,382
Desdemona is elected in the final round when Romeo's second preferences are transferred.
A candidate can win without meeting the quota when there are no more votes available for transfer.
In this particular scenario, surpluses were only redistributed in the first two stages.
However, in an election where more seats need to be filled, and with more candidates, the process can happen repeatedly through many stages of counting.
The summary scoreboard shows first preference votes and vote share to indicate electoral support across the country.
The bar chart at the top of the page shows the top 5 or 6 parties in terms of seats won in the assembly.
If more than 6 parties win seats, the parties with fewest seats are amalgamated into a grouping called Others.
In the event of a tie - for example two parties have two seats - the party with the most first preference votes nationwide will be named.
Each constituency page displays a summary of all parties' and candidates' first preferences.
You can follow how the stages of counting unfold on the 'stage by stage' tab. This shows who is elected and eliminated in each round and the transferred votes at each stage.
Seat change will not be shown at national or constituency level in this election. This is because the reduction in seats from 108 to 90 makes a valid comparison extremely difficult.

111,"Users of BBC services can already create an online account - known as a BBC ID - but this is not currently required in order to access iPlayer.
From Tuesday, BBC ID holders also have to add a postcode to their account.
TV Licensing has access to the information but the BBC says it has no current plans to use it for enforcement purposes.
The corporation says the changes are part of an attempt to make its services more personal and localised.
Anyone watching BBC programmes via iPlayer has been required to have a TV licence since the start of this month.
A BBC ID - which allows users to personalise BBC content such as online news - currently requires only an email address and password, though anyone wishing to comment on stories must also provide a date of birth.
About seven million accounts already exist, the BBC said.
By David Sillito, BBC media correspondent
Coming less than a month after the extension of the licence fee to the iPlayer, it's hard not to see this as just a way of encouraging people to pay up.
The inclusion of a postcode as part of the new compulsory sign-up information certainly suggests it could be a way of alerting TV licensing to homes that currently don't have a licence but are watching the iPlayer.
The BBC says the information won't be used for enforcement - but adds it may be in the future.
The personalisation argument has some weight. With young people watching less and less ""live"" TV, the key to ensuring they are even aware of what is on offer is to find out who's watching, track their tastes and try to tempt them with programmes that reflect their age and where they live.
All broadcasters want to know more about their audience, especially the harder-to-reach younger viewers.
The rule change earlier this month closed the so-called iPlayer loophole.
Previously, a TV licence was only necessary for viewers watching live television, allowing iPlayer users who only watched programmes after they had been broadcast to avoid paying the Â£145.50 annual fee.
The BBC has said ""significant numbers of new people"" have bought a licence since the new rules came into effect.
BBC director of radio Helen Boaden said the move was not connected to changes to the supposed loophole, but was ""about giving you a better BBC"".
She added: ""We will keep our processes under review to make sure they are effective. The government has asked us to review whether a verification system for accessing the iPlayer will be required in the future.""
Tony Hall, BBC director general, said: ""By learning about what you want and like we can take you to more of the great programmes you love, stories you might be interested in and content you might otherwise never have discovered.

112,"Researchers found that in Europe, trees grown since 1750 have actually increased global warming.
The scientists believe that replacing broadleaved species with conifers is a key reason for the negative climate impact.
Conifers like pines and spruce are generally darker and absorb more heat than species such as oak and birch.
The authors believe the work has implications for current efforts to limit rising temperatures through mass tree planting.
Europe's green canopy was dramatically thinned between 1750 and 1850, when the forested area diminished by 190,000 sq km.
Ironically the greater use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, slowed the timber rush, and from 1850 to the present day, Europe's forests grew by some 386,000 sq km and now cover 10% more land than before the industrial revolution.
However, the form and content of these new woods differed considerably from what went before.
In the distant past, these forests ran wild - but in the modern world, some 85% of Europe's trees are managed by humans. And over the past 150 years, foresters have adopted a scientific approach to woodlands - planting faster growing, more commercially valuable trees such as a Scots pine and Norway spruce.
The rapid re-forestation of great swathes of Europe has generally been seen as a good thing due to the trees' ability to soak up carbon, something that has become particularly relevant in recent decades.
But the new study questions the positive impact of all these new trees on the climate.
The research team reconstructed 250 years of forest management history in Europe - and found that the way forests are controlled by humans can lead to far less carbon being stored than would have been the case when nature was in charge.
Removing trees in an organised fashion tends to release carbon that would otherwise remain stored in forest litter, dead wood and soil.
Choosing conifers over broadleaved varieties also had significant impacts on the albedo - the amount of solar radiation reflected back into space.
""Even well managed forests today store less carbon than their natural counterparts in 1750,"" said Dr Kim Naudts who carried out the study while at the Laboratory of Climate Science and Environment in Gif-sur-Yvette, France.
Speaking to Science in Action on the BBC World Service, she said: ""Due to the shift to conifer species, there was a warming over Europe of almost 0.12 degrees and that is caused because the conifers are darker and absorb more solar radiation.""
The researchers say that the increase in temperature equates to 6% of the global warming attributed to the burning of fossil fuels. They say that is a significant amount and believe that similar impacts are likely in regions where the same type of afforestation has taken place.
Many governments have made planting trees a key part of their plans for dealing with climate change; China is building a ""great green wall"" of trees, set to cover around 400 million hectares when complete.
The authors suggest the world should look carefully at both the types trees that we are planting and the ways in which they are managed.
""We shouldn't put our hopes on forests to mitigate what is an emission problem,"" said Dr Naudts.
""Our results indicate that in large parts of Europe, a tree planting programme would offset the emissions but it would not cool the planet, especially not if the afforestation is done with conifers.""
The researchers believe that consideration should be given to a programme of replacement. As the conifers are harvested, more broadleaved species could replace them.
The study has been published in the journal Science.

113,"Harry Pell's own goal and a Reggie Lambe header in the first half virtually settled the issue and defender Tom Miller put the outcome beyond doubt with a second-half strike.
Carlisle's first attack produced a fifth-minute goal as Shaun Miller forced a corner and Danny Grainger's inswinger from the right had the Cheltenham defence panicked.
In the ensuing scramble, Pell's attempted clearance flew past his own goalkeeper Jon Flatt and into the net.
The home team were on target again in the 17th minute when Grainger's cross from wide on the left picked out Lambe, who directed a stooping header into the bottom corner.
Carlisle made the most of the conditions in the first half, with a gusting wind at their backs, and Miller and Richie Bennett both were inches away from scoring.
At the other end, Pell almost made amends in a Robins break, forcing Jack Bonham to dive full length to save a fizzing low drive.
Carlisle continued to press after the break and made it 3-0 in the 60th minute when Cheltenham failed to clear a Nicky Adams free-kick and Miller seized on Tom Parkes' pass on the edge of the area to curl a shot into the top right-hand corner.

The number of staff who said they were bullied has risen from 31% in 2013.
It was put into special measures last September because of ""serious failures"" in patient safety.
The trust runs the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford; the Kent and Canterbury in Canterbury; the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (QEQM) in Margate; the Buckland in Dover; and the Royal Victoria in Folkestone.
Sandra Le Blanc, director of human resources at the trust, said: ""The questionnaires were completed... a matter of weeks after the trust was put into special measures following the publication of the Care Quality Commission's (CQC) report.

Speaking later from her hospital bed, she said what had happened would not stop her from attending the ""terrific"" event.
As well as the extra fences and kerb protectors, 12 sets of amber safety lights have also been deployed around the NW200's 8.9-mile triangular circuit.
The lights are used to give riders an early warning of any incidents during practice or racing.
""The extra funding we have received has allowed us to make significant safety improvements for both riders and spectators,"" said event director, Mervyn Whyte.
""As race organisers our top priority is to try to make the racing as safe as possible.
""The new equipment we have purchased is another huge step in that process and we are very grateful for the support we have received.""

117,"According to dealer and gallery owner Matthew Marks, he died of natural causes at home in New York.
Known for vibrant works with geometric shapes and bright colours, the artist had retrospectives at New York's Guggenheim and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art over his career.
In 2013, he was presented with the National Medal of Arts by US President Barack Obama.
Kelly was born in Newburgh, New York, in 1923 and served in the US military during World War Two before studying art at Boston's School of the Museum of Fine Arts. He went on to travel and study in Paris.
On his return to New York, he held his first solo show in 1956.
Influenced by artists such as Picasso and Matisse, Kelly's work was dubbed by art historian Jules Langsner as ""hard-edge painting"".
His pieces included paintings, sculpture and tattoos.
Analysis by Will Gompertz, arts editor
Ellsworth Kelly was a giant of post-war American painting. He belonged to the pioneering New York-based Abstract Expressionist school that counted Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still among its number.
What made his work stand out (in every respect) was his commitment to working with colour at its greatest intensity, not mixed and applied wet-on-wet as was the preference for many of his peers.
By doing this he became the American artist who arguably bridged the gap between European modernism as practiced by Matisse and Picasso - and Manhattan's bullish expressionism.

120,"Juan Mata got the decisive goal for United when he stabbed in from Zlatan Ibrahimovic's flick, but Rostov threatened to take the game to extra time and Sergio Romero made two good saves late on.
The United goalkeeper first kept out Sardar Azmoun's flicked header before thumping away Christian Noboa's free-kick.
It was a largely frustrating night for United, who dominated for large periods without really threatening and also lost midfielder Paul Pogba to a hamstring injury.
Their best chances before the goal came in the first half, when Henrikh Mkhitaryan shot wide when one-on-one and Ibrahimovic twice hit the post.
United will find out on Friday who they will play in the quarter-finals, with the draw taking place at 12:00 GMT.
The Europa League is the only major trophy that has so far eluded United, but winning the competition is not just about collecting another piece of silverware.
With a guaranteed place in next season's Champions League for the winners, United, who are sixth in the Premier League, would not have to rely solely on finishing in the top four.
Mourinho showed he was in no mood to take any chances by naming a strong side against Rostov, with Ibrahimovic - who is serving a three-match domestic ban - reinstated.
The Swedish striker, absent from Monday's 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Chelsea, looked fresh and hungry from the outset, hitting the post from close range early on before cracking another effort against the upright before the break.
Those chances aside, United struggled to find a way through a packed Rostov defence and it looked as though they would have to rely on the goal they scored in Russia to scrape into the quarter-finals.
An inventive bit of skill by Ibrahimovic helped make the breakthrough in the end, but United know they will need to improve if they are to go all the way in the competition, with better sides than Rostov waiting.
It was a victory that came at a cost for Mourinho as he lost Pogba and Daley Blind to injury.
Midfielder Pogba has come in for criticism recently, but Mourinho clearly sees the £89m midfielder as a crucial part of his side.
The France international was making his 41st appearance of the season for United but has rarely dominated a game, and he was largely a peripheral figure here before pulling up with an apparent hamstring injury early in the second half. He will miss Sunday's Premier League game at Middlesbrough.
Mourinho was then forced into another change, and a reshuffle at the back, when defender Blind went off midway through the half with suspected concussion.
With a congested fixture list caused by United battling for Europa League success and a place in the Premier League top four, Mourinho will hope neither player is out for an extended period.
Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BT Sport: ""We were afraid of extra time. It was a difficult game.
""We have lots of enemies. Normally the enemies should be Rostov but we have a lot of enemies. It's difficult to play Monday with 10 men, it's difficult to play now, it's difficult to play 12 o'clock on Sunday. We have a lot of enemies.
""A lot of people might say we should have scored more goals. But a lot of things are going against us. The boys are amazing boys. We will probably lose the game on Sunday. Fatigue has a price.
""I will remember forever when I spoke to the Uefa delegate in Rostov. He told me if any of our players gets injured, the insurance paid. Whoever decided the Monday and Sunday games probably thinks the same way.""
United are next in action when they travel to Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Sunday (12:00 GMT).

121,"Being active is known to be beneficial but US researchers, writing in the journal Cancer, said they had found many women did too little.
Only a third met recommended activity levels.
UK breast cancer groups said women here also needed more support to keep active after having the disease.
The American study looked at the pre and post-diagnosis exercise levels of 1,735 women aged 20-74 who had breast cancer between 2008 and 2011 in North Carolina.
In the US and the UK, adults are recommended to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity each week.
But this study found only 35% of women who had experienced breast cancer met the physical activity guidelines.
In the UK, campaigners said women here also needed to exercise more.
Caroline Dalton, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ""Physical activity after a breast cancer diagnosis has been shown to improve a patient's chances of survival and there is also some evidence that it may help to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning.
""Keeping active may also help patients cope, both during and after treatment, by improving general health and wellbeing.""
She added: ""Although this study was conducted in America rather than the UK, the results suggest that women who have received a breast cancer diagnosis need better support to keep active.""
""There are no specific guidelines in place at the moment to tell us precisely how much physical activity is needed after a breast cancer diagnosis, but Breakthrough Breast Cancer suggests aiming for 3.5 hours per week, after checking with your treatment team to see what is appropriate for you.""
Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ""This study serves as a reminder of how important it is that women with breast cancer are made aware that physical activity can improve their chances of survival.
""Recent research has shown that even small increases to the amount of exercise done after a breast cancer diagnosis can give women a better chance of survival.
""This is why it is essential that women are given a clear written follow-up care plan, which should include practical advice about diet and exercise.""","Exercise can aid recovery after breast cancer but many women are not active enough, a study suggests."

Argentina had 29 shots over the 120 minutes, while the Swiss did not manage an effort on target after the 50th minute.
But Ottmar Hitzfeld's side created the best chances of the first half.
Argentina keeper Sergio Romero saved in quick succession from Granit Xhaka and Stephan Lichtsteiner, before denying Josip Drmic shortly afterwards.
""It was a game that we deserved to win in 90 minutes,"" said Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella.
""It was even during a first half in which they had two clear chances to score, but in the second half we were clearly superior. We had five or six shots at goal and, in extra time, we also had more chances.""
Defeat marked the end of Hitzfeld's 31-year managerial career.
The 65-year-old German is a two-time World Coach of the Year who won 19 major club trophies for Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Grasshoppers, before taking charge of the Swiss national team in 2008.

123,"A survey of more than 500 overseas students across 105 institutions showed 52% had a negative perception of the attempts to cut migration numbers.
Almost half of North American students in the UK shared this concern.
Universities have campaigned to have students counted separately from headline migration figures.
Business Secretary Vince Cable recently said that the UK's ""torrid"" debate on immigration risked damaging the economically valuable recruitment of overseas students.
He warned of the ""public panic"" over migrant numbers and how it could adversely affect overseas students.
The survey of attitudes of overseas students in the UK, commissioned by Regent's University in London, shows a contrasting picture.
While students feel that migration targets have made them feel less welcome, they have a positive account of their experience in the UK.
About four in five of the students backed the quality of their courses and teaching and almost nine in 10 would recommend studying in the UK.
There is also a distinction between the public drive to reduce migrant numbers and their private experience of people in the UK, with almost nine in 10 saying that they felt welcome.
There was more uncertainty about overseas students' relationship with other students and the wider university, with a quarter saying that they did not feel ""part of the university community"".
The survey found that 40% of overseas students ""mainly spend time"" with other students from their country and about one in five admitted feeling ""isolated"".
Almost a third of overseas students agreed with the suggestion that ""my university is only interested in the fees I pay"".
However, despite warnings that ""negative rhetoric"" about immigration could put off potential students, the application figures for this year show rising rather than falling interest in UK universities.
There have been drops from individual countries, but the overall figures from the admissions service Ucas, published last month, show that applications from overseas students are higher than last year.
Aldwyn Cooper, vice-chancellor of Regent's University, a private college that gained university status this year, said: ""These findings show that UK higher education is unmatched in its global reputation. However, there are worrying signs that the government's migration policy risks alienating overseas students in the UK.
""This is being compounded by the tendency in some institutions for overseas students to be left in de facto ghettos, rarely mixing outside their national groups.""
A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said that international students make a ""huge contribution"" to the UK and emphasised that ""there is no cap on the number of legitimate overseas students.
""But we need to ensure that the message gets through that they are fully welcome in the UK to study.
""Our universities are second only to the USA as the favoured destination for international students, and to maintain this strong appeal around the globe the government is developing an industrial strategy to ensure our universities stay ahead in the global race.""","More than half of overseas students in the UK say they have felt ""less welcome"" because of policies on migration, a survey suggests."
124,"Wollaton Hall in Nottingham attracted 175,117 visitors in 2011, the year it was used as Wayne Manor for the filming of The Dark Knight Rises.
Numbers have risen each year since then, reaching 291,393 in 2014.
The rise has been attributed to the ""Batman effect"" and other reasons such as marketing and specialised tours.
Nigel Hawkins, head of culture at Nottingham City Council, said visitors come from around the world.
""I think Batman is certainly helping,"" said Mr Hawkins.
""We are seeing probably a different age group coming and taking photographs outside the hall.""
Batman fan David Ellis came from Wednesbury in the West Midlands to visit the hall.
""I love visiting the locations of my favourite films and as a huge Batman fan the hall that [director] Chris Nolan chose for Wayne Manor has been on my list for some time,"" he said.
""It's great that the hall plays up the connection themselves as I've been to some film locations where they almost treat it as a secret.""
The attraction is playing up the connection this week by attempting to break the world record for the number of people dressed as superheroes in one place.
Only people who step inside the hall itself were counted in the annual visitor figures compiled by VisitEngland, so the thousands who visit the surrounding park were not included.
The Nottinghamshire village of Gotham also attracts Batman fans, as it indirectly inspired the naming of Gotham City when the Batman comics were created.

First-quarter growth was revised down slightly from 0.6% to 0.5%.
Other figures released on Monday showed unemployment in the zone was at its lowest since 2009, building on the picture of improving economic health across the area.
On Friday, figures showed Spain's economy, one of the worst-hit by the financial crisis, grew by 0.9% in the second quarter, suggesting the country's economy had finally grown back to the size it was before 2008.
The International Monetary Fund last week said the outlook for several eurozone economies was brighter than initially thought, with countries including France, Germany, Italy and Spain seeing growth forecasts revised up.
The European Central Bank is planning to tighten up monetary policy after years of pumping up activity through low interest rates and bond-buying.
It intends to begin the process in the autumn, although inflation remains low at 1.3%, well under the 2% target for the eurozone.

126,"It follows mounting criticism of the social media firm for not doing enough to root out fake news on its platform.
It has also just launched a new feature in four countries that will publish alternative news links beneath problematic articles.
But several experts said the measures did not do go far enough.
""Presenting audiences with context is helpful,"" said Tom Felle, a senior lecturer in digital journalism at City University.
""But it does nothing to stop the spread of this material, or to stop traffic going to fake news peddlers who are making money out of creating this material.""
Facebook has been criticised as being one of the main distribution points for fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
Voters were also flooded with hoax stories during the French presidential election in May.
The firm has previously been reluctant to take down potentially fake news stories, arguing that it does not want to be an ""arbiter of truth"".
Instead it identifies potentially false stories through a mixture of artificial intelligence (AI) and user detection. These are then sent to independent fact-checkers who place a flag next to hoax stories to alert readers.
On Thursday, however, the firm said it would start using ""updated machine learning"" to enhance detection.
""If an article has been reviewed by fact checkers, we may show the fact-checking stories below the original post,"" added Sara Su, product manager of News Feed, in a blog.
A spokesman later clarified that these stories would not be ""direct responses"" to fake articles, but factually accurate reports that offered an alternative.
On Thursday, the firm rolled out a new ""Related articles"" feature in the US, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
The feature, which the firm has been testing since April, places links to other news coverage beneath highly popular or questionable stories, offering users ""more perspectives and additional information"".
Brooke Binkowski, managing editor of fact-checking magazine Snopes, told the BBC: ""I applaud their efforts to 'flood out' fake news, a method of which I have been a proponent for a long time.""
However, she said that while AI was ""a good tool, it is also a blunt one"".
Mr Felle said if the firm really wanted to stop fake news, it needed to back the news industry in a better way.
""If Facebook wants to help journalism it needs to put its hand in its pocket and support quality, trusted news organisations to better reach audiences, and advertisers.""",Facebook is to step up its efforts to fight fake news by sending more suspected hoax stories to fact-checkers and publishing their findings online.
127,"Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, and Shaunean Boyle, 25, are jointly accused of murdering Owen  Creaney in July 2014.
On Monday, the trial heard extracts from a pre-prepared statement Ms Boyle gave to police.
The victim was assaulted in the hallway of Hughes's Moyraverty Court home in the early hours of 3 July, 2014.
It took two days for Mr Creaney, who was disabled and used a walking aid, to die. His body was then dumped into a recycling bin.
Both accused have admitted being present during the attack, but have both denied murder and have blamed each other for the violence.
As well as claiming she disarmed Mr Hughes, Ms Boyle also told police she stopped him from hitting Mr Creaney over the head with a dumbbell as he lay on his back after being punched, kicked, beaten and stamped on.
When asked why Mr Hughes attacked Mr Creaney, Ms Boyle claimed her co-accused was ""on steroids ... his head's been wrecked for weeks"".
She said the assault followed a row as her co-accused believed Mr Creaney knew who was responsible for breaking into his former home earlier that year.
As the murder trial at Belfast Crown Court entered its third week, the jury heard transcripts of police interviews with Ms Boyle following her arrest on Saturday July 5, 2014.
During her first interview, the mother of one, from Edenderry Park in Banbridge, refused to answer a majority of questions, but a pre-prepared statement was handed to the PSNI.
In the statement, Ms Boyle said she ""did not assault Fonzie [Mr Creaney] in any way"". She said: ""I tried to stop Stephen Hughes from hitting Fonzie, but every time I did try to stop Stephen, he pushed me away. Each time he pushed me I kept trying to stop him.
""At one point Stephen Hughes had a knife but I took it off him. I did this by grabbing the blade.""
She said that after the attack, both her and Hughes got Mr Creaney to his feet and carried him up the stairs, where he was placed on a reclining chair in a bedroom. Boyle said she placed a cushion under his head, whilst Mr Hughes placed a blanket over him.
Ms Boyle claimed that during this process Mr Creaney was ""mumbling"", but said that was something he did when he was drunk. She said she also ""asked him to squeeze my hand to make sure he was OK. I got him water... he was mumbling and moving his hand.""
In the statement, Ms Boyle also said Mr Creaney wet himself, and that she and Hughes showered him then dressed him in some of Mr Hughes's clothing.
She said that when she left the house on Thursday morning, she thought Fonzie was okay, that in the past she had known her friend to ""sleep for days"" and that she didn't think he was badly injured.
Ms Boyle also told police that when she returned to Moyraverty Court the following afternoon, Mr Creaney was ""sleeping and still mumbling"", that she checked on him between 20 and 30 times, and brought him water and juice.
She said that the following morning, Saturday 5 July, Mr Hughes told her ""Fonzie is dead"".
Ms Boyle's statement ended by her saying: ""I can't believe what has happened. What has happened is wrong.""
Ms Boyle said she did not help Mr Hughes put Mr Creaney's body in the bin.
She told police: ""If we thought for a second he was going to end up dead, I would have phoned for an ambulance.""
Mr Creaney died as a result of blunt force trauma to both his chest and head, including 15 fractured ribs and a broken breastbone, as well as bleeding of and tearing to the brain.",A woman jointly charged with murdering a Lurgan man told police she played no part in the fatal attack and grabbed a knife from her co-accused.

He said he had not driven since the incident and vowed never to again.
Mr Williams broke down in tears when the jury returned its not guilty verdict after three hours of deliberation.
Supporters of the girl's family also wept.
The jury heard Esmé and her mother Jessica Weir - who was pregnant - were heading to pre-school in Neston when the collision occurred.
Mrs Weir was walking just behind her daughter.
Mr Williams was delivering wood in a Ford Transit tipper van to a property on Gladstone Road.

But fewer people reported problems with traditional credit products, such as loans and overdrafts, MAT said.
Meanwhile, a BBC survey has found that the most adults in debt have not asked for advice on managing their problem.
Joanna Elson, chief executive of the MAT said: ""The gradual erosion of some families' surplus income in the face of rising prices has led to a new generation of debt problems, one to which more people are vulnerable, one which is harder to resolve, and one which has no definitive solution.
""We're hearing from more people in serious debt difficulty as a result of debts totalling less than Â£5,000. When there is little room in a household budget to meet basic expenses, paying off debts can seem impossible.
""Recent government announcements such as an increase in the minimum wage are a positive step towards helping these families, but more can be done.""
However, a survey for BBC North, conducted by Comres, has found that people are hesitant to seek help.

Jolie first got in touch with Ung more than a decade ago after first reading the book, which was published in 2000.
""Angelina and I met in 2001 in Cambodia, and immediately, I trusted Angelina's heart,"" said Ung.
""Through the years, we have become close friends, and my admiration for Angelina as a woman, a mother, a filmmaker and a humanitarian has only grown.
""It is with great honour that I entrust my family's story to Angelina to make into a film.""
Jolie, who is also a UN Special Envoy for refugees, made her feature film debut as a director with 2011's In the Land of Blood and Honey, set during the Bosnian war.
Her 2014 film Unbroken was nominated for three Oscars. It starred British actor Jack O'Connell as Olympian and World War Two prisoner of war survivor Louis Zamperini.
Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said they were ""proud"" to be working with Jolie on such an ""emotionally powerful and ultimately uplifting story"".
""Loung Ung's incredible journey is a testament to the human spirit and its ability to transcend even the toughest circumstances,"" he said.","Angelina Jolie is to direct a film about children caught up in Cambodia's Khmer Rouge regime for Netflix, based on a memoir by a former child soldier."

136,"The image was captured the day after the luxury liner sank in the Atlantic, killing more than 1,500 people.
It comes with a previously unpublished statement from the photographer, who describes seeing scrapings of red paint on the side.
The estimated guide price is between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000.
The photograph was taken by the chief steward of steamer the Prinz Adalbert, who was at the time unaware of the tragedy that had occurred the previous day.
RMS Titanic had been four days into a week-long trans-Atlantic crossing from Southampton to New York when the supposedly ""unsinkable"" ship struck the iceberg on 14 April 1912.
A lookout in the crow's nest, who had not been given binoculars, spotted the hazard just 37 seconds before the impact at 23:40 on 14 April.
The ship sank less than three hours later at around 02:20 on 15 April.
A statement by the chief steward of the Prinz Adalbert reads:  ""The Titanic disaster was not yet known by us.
""On one side red paint was plainly visible, which has the appearance of having been made by the scraping of a vessel on the iceberg.""
The document is then signed by the chief steward and three other crewmen.
Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: ""The photograph was acquired not long after the Titanic's sinking by Burlingham, Montgomery & Beecher, attorneys for Titanic's owners, White Star Line.
""This photograph, regarded by generations of Burlingham maritime lawyers as ""The Titanic Iceberg"" hung on the firm's walls from 1913 until it closed its doors in 2002.""
The lot will be auctioned by Henry Aldridge & Son in Devizes, Wiltshire on 24 October.","A photograph purporting to show the iceberg that sank the ill-fated Titanic is expected to fetch over Â£10,000 when it is sold at auction."

Ancelotti believes Wenger should be praised for the job he has done.
""He built a strong identity and a good style of football,"" said the Italian.
""Wenger has the experience to know that in our job it is normal to be criticised. For this reason he has no problems.
""I have a lot of respect for the job he has done at Arsenal.""
Former Chelsea boss Ancelotti was speaking before Wednesday's Champions League last-16 first leg tie between the sides in Germany.
With Arsenal fourth in the Premier League and 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, success in Europe and the FA Cup is looking increasingly likely to be the Gunners' best chance of securing silverware this season.
Arsenal face a tough test against a Bayern side they have met three times at this stage of the competition since 2005, losing on each of those three occasions.
However, Wenger believes his side possess the experience to cause their opponents problems.
""We know we play against Bayern who, basically, listening to you [reporters] are favourites,"" he said.
""We have to be very positive on the fighting front and playing front.
""When you look at their record they are always in the last four. It is a massive challenge but we are capable of dealing with it.""","Bayern Munich boss Carlo Ancelotti has spoken of his ""respect"" for Arsene Wenger and backed the Arsenal manager to deal with recent criticism."
138,"Riad Yassin told the BBC a ""short, sharp"" campaign was needed to weaken the rebels, who have forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.
Fresh overnight air raids reportedly targeted a number of Houthi positions.
Rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi has vowed not to surrender to what he called the ""unjustified aggression"".
Regional Shia power Iran, who Mr Yassin accused of backing the rebels, has also denounced the US-backed air strikes.
""They have to stop. Everybody has to encourage dialogue and national reconciliation in Yemen rather than making it more difficult for Yemenis to come together,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said.
Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia has said its main objective is to ""protect the government in Aden"".
Mr Hadi took refuge in the second city of Aden last month after fleeing Sanaa, where he had been under house arrest since the rebels took full control of the capital in January.
On Friday, Mr Hadi travelled from Saudi Arabia to Egypt to attend an Arab League summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
In an interview with the BBC at the summit on Thursday evening, Mr Yassin said no-one was happy about the intervention by the Saudi-led coalition.
But he added: ""I think if they completed their mission in the coming few days or few hours it will be stopped. It is a short, sharp campaign which really we have been forced to request.""
Mr Yassin said he did not know if Arab leaders would approve a ground offensive, which coalition members have said they are prepared to launch if the raids fail to halt the rebels' advance and force them to negotiate.
Sanaa was again rocked by explosions and anti-aircraft fire overnight. Warplanes bombed bases around the city used by units of the security forces allied to the rebels, as well as al-Anad air base in Lahj province, from which US military advisers were evacuated last week.

Meanwhile, air strikes in the Houthis' northern heartland of Saada targeted arms depots and the movement's leaders, residents and military officials said.
Since the air campaign began, at least 39 civilians - including six children under the age of 10 - have been killed, health ministry officials say.
People have been fleeing the capital, with long queues at petrol stations, and many shops and firms have shut.
Rebel forces are still fighting Popular Resistance Committees militiamen and Sunni tribesmen loyal to President Hadi in the south.
On Friday, at least 21 Houthis were killed when they were ambushed about 15km (9 miles) north of Aden, witnesses told the AFP news agency. Another eight people reportedly died in clashes around Aden's international airport.
Saudi and Egyptian warships were also believed to have been deployed to the Bab al-Mandab strait to secure the strategic passage between the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
In addition to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco and Sudan are contributing aircraft to ""Operation Storm of Resolve"", while Egypt, Jordan and Sudan were ready to take part in any ground offensive, Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV reported on Wednesday.
The channel also claimed that Pakistan was prepared to send troops, but on Friday the country's defence minister said it had made no decision.
The Houthis have said their aim is to replace Mr Hadi's government, which they accuse of being corrupt, and to implement the outcomes of a National Dialogue that was convened after Mr Hadi's predecessor Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to hand over power in 2011.
In a televised address on Thursday night, Abdul Malik al-Houthi said: ""If any armies come to occupy, the Yemeni people will prove once again that Yemen is the graveyard of invaders.""

139,"She is one of some 1,000 people who have named Lt Col Bedi Mobuli Engangela, who is on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
He has denied all the charges.
The UN says the trial is a test case for the Congolese military, which has often failed to convict high-ranking officers accused of sexual violence.
The woman, whose name was not disclosed, insisted on showing her wounds to the judges.
But she did not want Col Engangela to see her, so she entered the courtroom wearing an outfit that covered her whole body, including her face. She sat in a box with a hole on one side.
Only the judges peered in as she removed her veil. They flinched.
She told the court in the town of Kalehe, South Kivu province, she was raped four times during an attack from Lt Col Engangela's troops on her village.
The men then set her straw hut on fire with her and her son still inside, she said.
Col Egangela started his career in the army under former President Joseph Mobutu, before deserting to join a militia.
He was reintegrated into the army as part of a peace deal in 2005 and became commander of the 106 battalion in South Kivu, and is often known as Colonel 106.
But between 2005-2007, he is accused of deserting again, recruiting child soldiers and ordering attacks on several villages. He also allegedly collaborated with the Rwandan FDLR rebel group, based in DR Congo.
Sexual violence is a major problem in eastern DR Congo, where several armed groups still operate more than a decade after the official end of its conflict.
Both militias and the army have been accused but few senior officials have been convicted.

141,"Reuven Rivlin said Israel must address the community's grievances, which had been ignored.
It comes after police and protesters clashed in Tel Aviv on Sunday night.
Israel's PM meanwhile has met the Ethiopian Israeli soldier, whose beating by police fuelled tensions.
Benjamin Netanyahu praised Damas Pakedeh and said he was shocked by video which emerged last week showing the soldier being beaten by two police officers in a suburb of Tel Aviv.
One of the policemen involved has been fired and the other suspended from the force, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the BBC. An investigation into the incident is under way.
The protests on Sunday started peacefully as demonstrators blocked a busy road. Many walked with their hands held together in the air, to signify handcuffs. But the demonstration became more violent as night fell.
Some protesters threw stones, bottles and chairs and tried to enter the municipality building.
Police fired tear gas and stun grenades as protesters threw bottles and bricks.
At least 46 police and seven protesters were hurt, officials said. Dozens of protesters were arrested, police said.
President Rivlin blamed a ""handful of violent trouble-makers"" for the violence but said Israel must deal with Ethiopian Jews' grievances.
The protests, he added, exposed ""the pain of a community crying out over a sense of discrimination, racism, and of being unanswered.
""We must look directly at this open wound.""
Israel's President Reuven Rivlin was quick to respond to the weekend's disturbances with calming words - the country hadn't listened to its Ethiopian minority, he said.
It is listening today at least.
The police used considerable force to disperse the rioting crowds in Tel Aviv but the government is seeking to send a simultaneous signal that it recognises the strength of the Ethiopian minority's grievance about racism and discrimination in jobs and education.
It is an awkward twist in what began as a triumphant story for Israel which began with one of Zionism's most exotic initiatives - series of airlifts dating back to the 1980s which brought to Israel members of a religious minority with Jewish roots.
As black migrants from a country with a poorly-developed educational system, though, they have struggled to integrate into Israeli society and they have been left feeling that their treatment has never quite matched the imagination and generosity of the impulse which brought them here.
Ethiopian Jews living in Israel have long complained of discrimination, and similar protests in 2012 followed reports that some Israeli landlords were refusing to rent out their properties to Ethiopian Jews.
Ethiopian Jews' income is considerably lower than the general population, and they are much more likely to face limited educational opportunities and to end up in prison, according to The Ethiopian National Project, a non-governmental organisation which assists Ethiopian Jews in Israel.
Tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel in secret operations in the 1980s and 1990s to escape famine and civil war. There are now around 135,000 Ethiopian Jews living in Israel.","Israel's president has said Ethiopian Israelis' protests against alleged discrimination ""revealed an open and raw wound"" at the heart of Israeli society""."

A notice on the school gate said it had been placed into voluntary liquidation.
Governors said the closure was regrettable and that they were grateful to teachers, parents, suppliers and benefactors for their support.
Elaine Prentice, whose three-year-old daughter attended the nursery school, said the way parents had been treated was very sad.
""A lot of them are very upset. We have only got four days to find a new school,"" she said.
""The governors must have known in September that things were bad, but new staff were taken on.""
A spokesman for West Sussex County Council said parents of children at the school who wished to apply for a place at local maintained schools should contact the pupil admissions team.
""We aim to process in year applications within 10 school days,"" he said.
RSM Restructuring Advisory Ltd said it had been instructed to assist the directors in preparing the school to be liquidated, but had not been appointed as liquidators.
The school has places for 100 pupils from reception to year eight and 50 pupils in the nursery.
The email said there had been a significant drop in pupil numbers during the summer months.
It added that a team had been appointed to develop a long-term funding strategy for the school, but it was unable to remain solvent to implement it.
Ms Prentice said she had paid Â£1,400 in advance for her child to attend the nursery two days a week this term, but would have to attempt to recover the money from the liquidator, RSM UK in Crawley.

144,"The case related to the 2003 killings of 200 residents of Bogoro village in the Ituri region of DR Congo.
The court in The Hague heard reports of victims being burned alive, babies battered and women raped.
Mr Ngudjolo denied ordering the attack, saying he learned of it days later.
He had been charged with seven counts of war crimes and three of crimes against humanity. Prosecutors said he had enlisted child soldiers to carry out the killings. Some of the killings were carried out with machetes.
But presiding Judge Bruno Cotte said the court acquitted Mr Ngudjolo of all charges, saying the prosecution had ""not proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui was responsible"" for the crimes committed.
He said the decision was unanimous, and that witness testimony had been ""too contradictory and too hazy"".
By Jonathan KachelewaBBC News, Eastern DR Congo
Fighting is still going on in the mineral-rich Ituri region. All the different armed groups in the area have formed a coalition. They include Mr Ngudjolo's FNI, which is drawn from the Lendu ethnic group, and its former enemies from the Hema ethnic group.
Some former fighters joined the army during a series of peace deals, but all the others in this region have now joined together. As ever, they are fighting for control of the region's gold mines, as well as for their own protection.
A UN report says the rebels are backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which denies it.
The violence in Ituri was a part of the DR Congo war. It remains overshadowed by fighting elsewhere in eastern DR Congo. Some 50,000 people were killed in the province in four years before the European Union sent a peacekeeping force in 2003 - its first mission outside Europe.
Mr Ngudjolo showed no emotion at the acquittal, according to the Associated Press news agency. His lawyer, Jean-Pierre Kilenda, said his client had always insisted he was innocent.
In its summary, the court stressed that the ruling did not mean it believed no crimes were committed in Bogoro ""nor does it question what the people of this community have suffered on that day"".
""The chamber also emphasised that the fact of deciding that an accused is not guilty does not necessarily mean that the chamber finds him innocent,"" the ICC said in a statement.
""Such a decision simply demonstrates that, given the standard of proof, the evidence presented to support his guilt has not allowed the chamber to form a conviction 'beyond reasonable doubt'.""
Judge Cotte ordered Mr Ngudjolo's immediate release, and rejected prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's attempts to have him detained pending an appeal.
""The chamber dismisses the prosecution's application for further detention,"" Judge Cotte said, adding that there were ""no exceptional circumstances"" to detain Mr Ngudjolo further.
Human Rights Watch said the verdict ""leaves the victims of Bogoro and other massacres by his forces without justice for their suffering"".
""The ICC prosecutor needs to strengthen its investigations of those responsible for grave crimes in Ituri, including high-ranking officials in Congo, Rwanda and Uganda who supported the armed groups fighting there,"" said Geraldine Mattioli-Zeltner, the group's international justice advocacy director.
The Coalition for the ICC, a campaign group that monitors the court's work, said the verdict was ""a hard blow for the victims and affected communities who had placed all their hopes in the Court to deliver justice, considering the great harm they suffered during the ethnic war in Ituri"".
The verdict is only the second in the 10-year history of the ICC, and the first acquittal.
In March, Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga, Mr Ngudjolo's enemy in Ituri, was found guilty of recruiting and using child soldiers between 2002 and 2003. He was sentenced to 14 years in jail.
The conflict in Ituri was a distinct part of the war that raged in DR Congo following the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda and involved troops and fighters from several neighbouring countries.
Militia leaders from all sides have been accused of using the conflict to profit from the region's mineral reserves, especially gold.",The International Criminal Court has ordered that former Congolese militia leader Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui should be freed after he was acquitted of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The Great Big Cornish Gig Project was the brainchild of amputee Al Henderson.
The former Royal Marine, who was injured on a tour of duty in Afghanistan with 40 Commando in 2010, said the project had been a huge success.
""It's brilliant working with a great group of like-minded guys and people have got some good stuff out of it,"" he told BBC News.
""We've got people going on boat building courses and wood turning courses, so it's been a huge success,""
Describing the gig as ""a gorgeous boat with a light and lovely glide"", Mr Henderson said Valiant has been painted in Help for Heroes colours.

The gig will take part in the World Pilot Gig Championships on the Isles of Scilly at the end of the month.
Project manager Mike Selwood said the aim of the project was to open up new opportunities for wounded military personnel as well as showcasing the heritage behind Cornish gigs.
All modern Cornish pilot gigs are based on drawings of a boat built in 1838 by William Peters of St  Mawes. They must be made from Elm and be 32ft (9.8 m) long and 4ft 10in (1.5m).","A traditional Cornish pilot gig, built of Cornish elm and crewed by injured veterans, has rowed from Cornwall to the Isles of Scilly."

The Welsh Government, which is considering whether to underwrite more than £200m to build the course, said it was ""disappointed"" by the report.
Circuit of Wales said directors had been exonerated of ""false claims"".
The report has prompted calls for an investigation into whether ministers broke EU rules on funding private sector businesses, although Circuit of Wales said it has given them a ""clean bill of health"".
The Welsh Government is scrutinising details of the £425m project.
It wants to study plans in detail and perform due diligence before deciding whether to support the project further.
As well as a motorbike circuit, the proposals now include mountain bike trails, a BMX park, concert facilities and indoor skiing.
There are hopes of 6,000 jobs and 750,000 visitors a year, while the development has the rights to MotoGP until 2024.
The firm behind the project, the Heads of the Valleys Development Company (HoVDC) has had £9.3m of taxpayers' money in loans and grants so far.
Another £16m loan has been agreed but has not been handed over yet.
The WAO report said:
Almost £1m went to a company called Aventa, owned by HoVDC's chief executive Michael Carrick.
However, the audit said £35,000 spent on Mr Carrick's garden in Cambridgeshire and £4,000 sponsoring political events was paid for by Aventa and not by HoVDC or public funds.
The Welsh Government guaranteed - and has since paid - a bank loan to HoVDC of more than £7m.
Ministers guaranteed the loan even though civil servants said it ""would be very likely to be considered to be in breach of the (EU) state aid rules"".
The project also received a property development grant of £2m, £300,000 of which was spent buying a motorcycle engineering company in Buckinghamshire called FTR.
The report said the Welsh Government could not explain ""to our satisfaction"" why it approved the funding, which was written off when FTR went bust.
The audit was launched following concerns raised by Monmouth MP David Davies who has been highly critical of the Circuit of Wales and has questioned whether it is viable.
""This can't possibly go ahead at the moment,"" he said.
""The idea of putting £200m of public money at risk with a company that's unable to account properly for the £9m it's had is totally unacceptable.""
He called for a full statement by Economy Secretary Ken Skates and said there should be an investigation into whether EU rules were broken.
Mr Skates has promised to thoroughly assess the final plans for the project before deciding whether to help underwrite the cost.
Developers said the £430m they need would come from private sources, but they want the taxpayer to guarantee about £210m. A final decision is expected next month.
Ministers had already turned down two earlier applications.
Auditor General for Wales Huw Vaughan Thomas said: ""It's unfortunate that, in the case of the Circuit of Wales, we have identified significant shortcomings and so the Welsh Government needs to learn from my report, particularly if it decides to provide any further support for the project to progress.""
Nick Ramsay, chairman of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, said the report was the latest example of poor handling of Welsh Government funding for the private sector.
""I am particularly concerned that the auditor general has identified a lack of Welsh Government oversight of payments made by the project to related companies, and also the use of taxpayers' money to purchase a Buckinghamshire-based engineering company that later went into administration,"" he said.
Circuit of Wales said the report represents a ""clean bill of health"" for the plans and project and shows that its directors ""have been completely exonerated of the false claims made over the misuse of public funds"".
It added: ""The report shows that we have always operated within conventional commercial practices, ordinary company activity and standard accounting processes and, where the specific Welsh Government loan is concerned, very carefully adhered to and implemented advice on spending eligibility provided by the Welsh Government's relevant officials.""
A Welsh Government spokesman said it was disappointed by a number of aspects of the report.
""For example, the report makes repeated reference to our agreement to provide £16million repayable business finance to HoVDC, but  fails to acknowledge that we subsequently took that offer off the table for this latest proposal - despite us pointing this out to the Wales Audit Office,"" he said.
He described it as ""a complex project"", but added: ""We are satisfied that we have assessed risk against value for money for the taxpayer and have sought to secure the maximum security available from the developer.""
The spokesman said funding support was provided to help develop the business proposition for the circuit, to secure planning permission and private finance.
Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent
Circuit of Wales is very different from most other projects which have asked for help from the Welsh Government.
For a start, many companies asking for assistance already have some assets, against which a loan or grant can be given.
But this is a project that has grown from a blank sheet of paper - very different from an Aston Martin or a Ford seeking support for investment.
Grants or loans are often made against existing assets, allowing the tax-payer to be reimbursed if fortunes change.
But the HoVDC was specifically set up to develop the Circuit of Wales.
It is a regeneration project for undeveloped moorland; an ambitious plan originating from a blank piece of paper. So, there are no traditional assets to secure or underpin financial support, making it a more risky decision.
The report makes clear that it is not judging the viability of the project but rather how the Welsh Government made decisions about its initial support package, how it managed risks and how it checked funding was used for what it was meant to.
This is the first time we have been able to see the details of negotiations between the developers and the Welsh Government. It explains some of what has been going on behind the scenes - and what has clearly been an uncomfortable and chastening experience for some of those involved.
""A safe bet?"" You can still watch BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme on the Circuit of Wales on BBC iPlayer.","There were ""significant shortcomings"" in the way £9.3m of taxpayers' money was spent on plans for Circuit of Wales at Ebbw Vale, a watchdog has found."

149,"The plan would have put standards into the hands of the livestock industry.
Animal welfare groups - including the RSPCA and Compassion in World Farming - were concerned this could lead to a lowering of welfare standards. But others said the rules needed to be changed to reflect advances in science.
The government said it had reconsidered the move ""in light of views raised"".
It said the current statutory system would stay in place, but that it would ""continue to work with industry"" to improve the animal welfare code system.
The current animal welfare code on farming chickens for meat and breeding was due to be revoked on 27 April, to be replaced at the same time by new ""industry-led"" guidelines drawn up by the British Poultry Council (BPC).
The BPC would have been charged with enforcing these guidelines.
The government had intended to reform other areas of livestock including cattle, sheep and pigs, in the same way.
BPC chairman John Reed said: ""We're disappointed by the change of policy at Defra. What this means now is that we, along with other livestock sectors, will be left with outdated welfare guidance.""
The BPC was unaware of the new developments until shortly before the announcement was made by Defra.
Mr Reed added: ""We supported the move towards jointly-owned guidance and we have contributed a significant amount of resource to this piece of work and are frustrated that it has been repealed before we were able to publish the content.
""By revoking its decision, Defra is walking away from an opportunity to ensure welfare guidance is kept up to date with the latest research using industry expertise.""
A Defra spokeswoman said: ""We have the highest standards of animal welfare in the world and no changes have been proposed to the legislation upholding them.
""We want to draw more closely on the expertise of the farming industry to ensure our welfare codes reflect the very latest scientific and veterinary developments.
""In light of views raised, we have given the matter further consideration and believe we can achieve this objective by retaining the existing statutory codes.""
Reacting to Defra's decision Peter Stephenson, from Compassion in World Farming, said: ""I am delighted, surprised and very, very pleased that the government has recognised the amount of damage that this would do.""
Andrew Tyler, director of campaign group Animal Aid, said: ""We are pleased to hear that sustained pressure has compelled Defra to reverse its decision and retain the statutory element of the codes. That means court cases stand a better chance of succeeding.""
The RSPCA also welcomed the move, saying it had been concerned guidance documents might not contain the same level of welfare information as the existing codes.
A spokesman said: ""It is vitally important that the codes of recommendations for farm animals and pets in England remain statutory and developed under appropriate governmental oversight, and so we are very pleased with the government's decision.""
Meanwhile, Sean Wensley, the president of the British Veterinary Association (BVA) said his organisation had not ""opposed the concept of moving to non-statutory codes"", which he said were ""in urgent need of updating"" to reflect the latest animal welfare science.
""However, we have questioned the way in which the consultation has taken place and raised concerns that public confidence could be undermined by a process that wasn't sufficiently transparent,"" he added.",The government has abandoned a controversial plan to repeal animal welfare codes.

But Surrey Police said ""an extensive and thorough investigation"" had not found evidence to support the story.
The force added: ""We had to act quickly to prevent what was suspected to be a risk to a child's life.""
The victim was described as white, about 4ft (1.2m) tall and wearing a red T-shirt and navy blue jeans.
He was said to be ""taken against his will"" but no parent reported a child matching the description as being missing.
On Friday, Supt Chris Edwards of Surrey Police said he was ""completely satisfied"" with the credibility of the witness.
But in a statement, the force said that after re-interviewing the man at length, and as a result of its inquires, ""no further information has come to light to corroborate the report"".
The senior investigating officer, Det Supt Pete Fulton, said officers had reviewed hours of CCTV from across the area, carried out house-to-house enquiries, talked to commuters at a railway station and checked potential vehicles matching the description.
He said missing children databases were checked and police received more than 100 calls from members of the public in fewer than 24 hours, ""all of which takes a significant amount of time"".
He said: ""We are the sure the public understands that when information such as this is received we treat it extremely seriously and must do all we can to investigate what's happened.""
The owner of a van pictured in a CCTV image and initially circulated by police was traced and ruled out of the inquiry.
A bicycle said to be left by the roadside after the alleged abduction was also later revealed to belong to an unconnected person, police said.
Det Sup Fulton said: ""It is understandable this has caused a considerable amount of concern and confusion in the area which will last beyond just these few days.
""We will continue to work with the community and realise that this has been disruptive and had a large impact, however I hope that you are reassured that we take your safety extremely seriously.""

This will feature grassland and mounds of logs for refuge and hibernation.
Great crested newts became a European Protected Species following a dramatic decline in their population across Europe.
This means it is an offence to capture, kill or disturb them, as well as damage or destroy their breeding sites or resting places without an appropriate licence.
Adrian Vass from Natural England said: ""This licence represents a significant step forward for both Durham constabulary and one of our most cherished native species.

153,"As part of the initiative Strathclyde Police refer youngsters for intensive support from the charity, Includem.
A report, by the charity, looked at the progress made by 23 teenagers, aged 14 to 18, by March this year.
Among nine teenagers who left the scheme there was a 47% reduction in the offences they were charged with in the six months after moving on.
The charity also reported a 62% reduction in offending, with a 73% reduction in violent offences, for those still being supported by the project.
The two-year initiative, which started last January last, is funded by the Scottish government and the Robertson Trust.
The teenagers referred to Includem were responsible for crimes including possession of an offensive weapon, police assault and vandalism.
The charity looked at the six months prior to them joining the scheme compared to the six months after they left.
Angela Morgan, chief executive of Includem, said: ""The reason they were singled out and referred to us was because they were reoffending and particularly difficult for police and others to work with.""
""When you look at the backgrounds of young people we work with they have not had good experiences of what adults are.
""This is not an excuse. We are very challenging to young people. But we show them how it can be different and give them that bridge.""
Includem estimated the project costs £6,656 per young offender every six months, on average.
Ms Morgan said the cost was far lower than the estimated £40,000 per year if they went to jail.
She said: ""In terms of saving money and putting young people on a path to better outcomes, we've achieved a lot in a relatively short space of time.""
The programme is voluntary but offenders referred to it attend around 80% of all appointments, the report said.
Sandra White, SNP MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, said: ""Strathclyde Police are showing the way with this scheme which has achieved an enormous amount in a short period of time.
""Events in England over the last week underline the importance of projects like this and I am certain other forces will now be looking to learn from what is being achieved by Includem.
She added: ""The Scottish Government's investment in 1,000 extra police officers has also helped drive crime rates down to a 32-year low and make Scotland's streets safer.

After trailing 3-0, Niall McGinn and Andy Considine netted for the Dons at Celtic Park.
""To beat 75 points would be a fantastic achievement,"" said McInnes.
""It's important that we still try to play with an edge. I think that demonstrates a proper team, if you can keep going all the way to the end of the season.
""It's important for me to try and beat our points tally for last season.
""We've got two games to go and try and do that and we'll try and finish the season strong because I think it's important we finish properly.""
Aberdeen finish their campaign with home matches against Hearts and Ross County.
McInnes's men - who will finish as runners-up for a second year in a row - started the season strongly with eight straight league wins but slipped below Celtic in the autumn.
A second home win of the season over Ronny Deila's side in February kept Aberdeen in the hunt but Celtic's consistency ultimately secured them a fifth straight championship.
""There's been a lot of criticism at times over the season for the manager and the team but I think their league form is up there with any championship-winning team,"" McInnes said of Celtic.
""For them to go through the full campaign only losing three games, you can see why they've won it and we congratulate them for that.""
And, of Sunday's match, McInnes said: ""We had great chances to score again. And probably easier chances - harder to miss than score.
""Second half, at least we showed fight, we showed our ability on the ball. We showed good aggression with our play and we created chances.

Police said it was ""not a mercy killing"" and Jones, a heroin addict, was ""not motivated by altruism but by greed"".
She was jailed for four and a half years at Manchester Crown Court.
Mr Makinson was suffering from ""crippling depression and anxiety"" following the death of his sister-in-law and mother in 2012, the collapse of his business and the break-up of his relationship, police said.
He had previously made two attempts to kill himself and enlisted the help of acquaintance Jones.
On 1 January last year, he asked Jones to buy him some heroin and prepare an injection which would bring about a fatal overdose , said police.
However, officers said, in an attempt to keep some of the heroin for herself, Jones did not give Mr Makinson enough to kill him and he was found by friends having suffered a non-fatal overdose.
A month later, Mr Makinson again enlisted Jones' help to bring about his death, and on the second occasion the dose was fatal.
Jones told her then-partner about what she had done, and he recorded the conversations on his mobile phone. When the pair split up last year he told police.
Det Ch Insp Richard Jackson said: ""Mr Makinson needed psychological help but was instead injected with heroin and left alone to die by a woman whose primary motivation was to obtain drugs for her own use.
""A man came to her in desperation and instead of providing a helping hand, she provided the killer blow.""",A woman who gave a lethal heroin injection to a man who wanted to end his own life has been jailed.

Only James Hildreth and Craig Overton showed much resilience with the bat before both being dismissed for 41.
Lewis Gregory and veteran Alfonso Thomas then took a late wicket each as Worcestershire reached 35-2 at stumps.
Home skipper Daryl Mitchell's decision to bowl first looked to have paid off when Morris tempted Somerset captain Marcus Trescothick to edge behind to Ben Cox in just the fourth over of the day.
Morris then removed Johann Myburgh and Tom Cooper in the same fashion before taking his fourth wicket of the morning when Jim Allenby nicked the ball to Mitchell at second slip to leave Somerset wobbling on 71-4.
Hildreth, who already had 334 runs under his belt from his first two Championship games, steadied things with Alex Barrow (26) but both fell in successive overs after lunch as the visitors slumped to 134-6.
Overton helped Somerset past 200, striking seven fours and a six in his 56-ball innings, but Morris returned to dismiss him to pick up his first Division One five-wicket haul.
Worcestershire have now earned maximum bowling points 28 times in their last 29 Championship matches.
When Worcestershire replied, Richard Oliver was caught and bowled by Gregory before Tom Fell edged a lifting delivery from Thomas to slip, but captain Mitchell remained at the crease on 20 not out as the hosts closed 215 runs behind.
Worcestershire fast bowler Charlie Morris:
""It was fantastic to bowl Somerset out. It was doing a bit but I think it's a good cricket wicket.
""There's enough there if you get the ball in the right place, and certainly enough bounce and movement.
""Having said that, if you miss your line and length, it's a pretty true track.""
Somerset batsman James Hildreth:
""Looking at the pitch it seems quite good, but there has been lateral movement off the seam and it's a bit up and down.
""All in all, we'll take 250. It could be enough to work with. You always aim for 400 and maximum batting points but sometimes you have to adjust according to the wicket.
""Tomorrow could be a bit boring, bowling in the channels and not trying to do too much. Wickets will come.""",Worcestershire paceman Charlie Morris took five wickets before Somerset fought back on the opening day of the County Championship game at New Road.

""I'm very happy to see that I can produce a performance like I did the last two weeks,"" said Federer.
""That clearly makes me believe that this was just a stepping stone to many more great things in the future.""
Federer has not won a Grand Slam title since Wimbledon in 2012, but played superbly throughout the tournament, losing only one set on the way to the final.
In a memorable match on Centre Court, the fourth seed fought back from 5-2 down in the fourth set to force a decider.
But Djokovic broke in the 10th game to win his second title at the All England Club and his seventh Grand Slam crown.
""It was a great match and I enjoyed being a part of it,"" added Federer.
""Winning or losing, it's always something special in the Wimbledon final and something you'll remember, even more so when the match was as dramatic as it was today.
""I'm very pleased with the way things went throughout the match. It was a high-quality match and it was good stuff from both players.
""Clearly we both walk away happy from here. I mean, him more happy than I am. But still, I'm happy overall.""
Federer enjoyed the majority of the support from a packed crowd, which included the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.
The Swiss met the Royal couple after the match but said he was too upset to hold down a conversation.
""I wasn't in a great state,"" he said. ""I was unbelievably sad at that moment just when I left the court, so it was a difficult moment for the three of us.
""But they were very sweet to comfort me and wish me well.""","Wimbledon runner-up Roger Federer said he hoped his performance in the tournament would be a ""stepping stone"" to more success."

161,"The legal row centred on plans to replace Dudley Central Mosque on Castle Hill with one on land off Hall Street.
The Dudley Muslim Association (DMA) bought the land from the council, but the authority wanted to buy it back
The DMA accused the council of ""caving in"" after protests from groups, including the English Defence League.
The three appeal judges unanimously ruled in favour of the council.
Amjid Khan from the DMA said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision, which he claimed came from the council ""caving in"" after protest marches were organised by the English Defence League, and a similar group, Britain First.
He said: ""We made every effort to work with the council and other leaderships to construct a modern fit-for-purpose mosque and community facility to meet the ever-growing needs of our disadvantaged community.

""Faced with vociferous opposition from various groups, the Dudley leadership at all levels caved in. This leadership can regrettably take pride in preventing an otherwise respectful and co-operative community from fulfilling its ambition to build up-to-date premises in Hall Street.""
But leader of the council, Pete Lowe, said the authority had ""always acted lawfully and reasonably"" in an ""open and transparent scrutiny process supported by all political parties"".
The legal hearings were about a contractual dispute dating back to 2005, when the council transferred the land at Hall Street to the DMA, with a clause that the land would transfer back to the council if the proposed development was not completed by the end of 2008.
Earlier this year, an offer by the DMA to pay £325,000 to settle the dispute and retain the land was rejected by the council.
The authority has acknowledged a need for a new mosque to replace the existing building in Castle Hill, which is not fit for purpose, and has said it will work with the DMA to find an alternative site.
Mr Khan said the Muslim community ""will now need a period of calm reflection and consider its future progress"".
The Bishop of Dudley, the Right Reverend Graham Usher has urged the local community to ""move forward in the spirit of reconciliation and shared endeavour"" in an attempt to find a location for the new mosque, for which ""there is an urgent need"".
The DMA must hand the land back to the authority in January, and was also ordered to pay the council's legal costs.",A long-running dispute over the location of a new mosque has been settled by the Court of Appeal in favour of Dudley Borough Council.
162,"Charlie Daniels opened the scoring after Junior Stanislas' free-kick came back off a post, before Ryan Mason's shot deflected in off Steve Cook to draw the game level.
Cook headed in moments later to restore Bournemouth's lead, before Stanislas netted from the spot and then added a smart finish after the break.
Callum Wilson headed in late on before Dan Gosling grabbed a sixth.
Hull finally sorted Mike Phelan's immediate future this week by offering him the manager's job on a full-time basis until the end of the season, and his first task must be to sort the Tigers' defensive problems.
The Hull boss made two changes to his back four in a bid to change their fortunes, but Bournemouth ripped the visitors apart and Phelan's side have now conceded 17 goals in their past four Premier League games.
Hull right-back Ahmed Elmohamady proved an occasional threat going forward, but could not deal with the pace and trickery of Bournemouth's Jordon Ibe in his own third.
Harry Maguire was also brought into the heart of Hull's defence for his full Premier League debut, but will need to learn fast if he is to survive at this level, losing possession on 13 occasions from the back.
Bournemouth produced some great attacking football, but the Tigers also allowed the likes of Cook, Stanislas and Wilson to lose their markers and enjoy simple finishes inside the box.
Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe named an unchanged side for their third-successive Premier League game and his players appear to be reaping the rewards.
The Cherries' main threat came at the feet of Stanislas, directly involved in four of his side's six goals, and Ibe, a club-record signing from Liverpool in the summer.
But it was Bournemouth's build-up play that caught the eye, with a midfield trio of Jack Wilshere, Andrew Surman and Harry Arter all enjoying a passing accuracy well above 90%.
Wilshere again failed to complete 90 minutes for his new side, but replacing the England international with Gosling late on is a favourite change of Howe's, with the substitute finding similar pockets of space and adding the hosts' sixth goal.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: ""We got the goals today that some of our attacking players deserved and probably our season deserved.
""We were very clinical and when the chances came we finished them off - which hasn't always been the case this season.

""We gifted them a goal, but fair play to the players because at that moment the game could have spun the other way.
""Jack Wilshere is improving all the time and had a big bearing on the game today.""

""We've got to grow up. Unless we concentrate and be disciplined, we won't get to where we want. What we've done today is not good enough.

163,"The Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, also involves counterparts from the US and China.
US officials said China had lobbied members for the issue to be left out of the traditional closing statement.
But China said ""certain other countries"" had interfered.
China has been aggressively staking its claims in the resource-rich South China Sea by reclaiming land and building airstrips and facilities on disputed reefs, angering neighbours who have overlapping claims.
The US and others have accused China of militarisation, but China says the construction is legal and for civilian purposes.
The clash of words comes days after the US angered Beijing by sailing a warship in an area of the sea claimed by China.
Contested South China Sea
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) makes decisions on a consensus basis, and has a principle of not getting involved in member's affairs.
Its defence meetings have in the past failed to produce joint declarations over disagreements over the South China Sea issue.
On Wednesday, Malaysia cancelled a planned signing ceremony for the joint statement, without giving a reason.
But a US official told reporters the talks broke down because China was insistent that the final statement omit any mention of the South China Sea, which several countries felt that was ""inappropriate"".
""This was an Asean decision but in our view no statement is better than one that avoids the important issue of China's reclamation and militarisation in the South China Sea,"" Reuters quoted the official as saying.
China's defence ministry issued a statement on its official microblogging Weibo account saying China had established a ""common understanding"" with Asean on the contents of the statement.
""But certain other countries disregarded this existing common understanding, attempting to force and insert content unrelated to this summit's discussion into the joint declaration, completely straying from the Asean defence meeting mechanism's aims and principles,"" it said.
""The blame lies completely with these other countries,"" it added.","A meeting of South East Asian defence ministers is to end without a joint statement, amid disagreements over mentioning China's activity in the South China Sea."
164,"Couch, who claimed a career-best individual 10m World Series silver at the weekend, has regularly finished on the podium alongside new synchronised partner Lois Toulson this season.
Elizabeth Ferris was the last GB woman to secure an Olympic diving medal, with bronze at the 1960 Games in Rome.
""To get to the top you have to aim for the top,"" Couch, 26, told BBC Sport.
""At my first Olympics in 2008 I was there to enjoy diving for Team GB and there was no chance of a medal, but now I have more experience and I'm competition ready, so it would be lovely to achieve my [Olympic medal] dream.""
Couch was controversially denied a place in the individual 10m platform competition at London 2012 and finished fifth alongside Sarah Barrow in the 10m synchronised event.
Barrow's chronic shin injury problems saw the pair broken up last year, with Couch partnered by rising star and European Games champion Toulson for the National Diving Cup in January.
A sluggish performance there saw Barrow and Couch re-united for the Rio Test Event, where they secured Team GB a 10m synchro Olympic berth.
However, Barrow has since been dropped from the GB squad, with Couch and Toulson going on to secure four successive World Series medals over the last couple of months.
""It hasn't been easy,"" admitted Couch. ""But I'm quite laid back and easy-going, so I've not let it affect me too much.
""At the beginning it was a bit rushed [with Toulson] as we hadn't had much time together to practise, but now we're training really well and we're on the right track.""
British Diving is currently enjoying a period of impressive World Series success, which follows a record-breaking 2015 World Championships.
Olympic bronze medallist Tom Daley and new synchronised diving partner Dan Goodfellow, as well as 3m springboard duo Jack Laugher and Chris Mears have regularly finished on the podium this season.
""It's amazing to watch and it's incredible what Great Britain is doing at the moment,"" she told BBC Sport.
Couch's next major event will be the European Championships at the London Aquatic Centre in May, ahead of the Olympic selection trials in Sheffield the following month.
""I would love to get a gold medal with Lois at the Europeans and it would be an amazing confidence boost,"" she said.
""The last time I won one was in 2012 with Sarah Barrow, so it would be great to do it again in Olympic season.
""I just can't wait to get out and perform in front of a big crowd.
""All of that support and competing for Great Britain is what you dream of as a child and, although it's a bit of pressure, it's good pressure and I think it always helps to have a few nerves.""

165,"Last year, 16,900 motorists in England and Wales were issued with Â£100 fixed-penalty notices after being caught, down from 29,700 in 2014.
The RAC said the figures indicated ""attitudes are clearly relaxing as a result of drivers no longer fearing punishment"".
The government said it is shortly to announce tougher penalties.
Over the past five years the number of penalties issued has fallen by 86%, according to police data for England and Wales.
The road safety charity Brake said the number of fines does not reflect the ""rapidly growing problem"" of mobile usage by drivers.
Mike Bristow, spokesman for Brake, said: ""Instead, these figures are evidence of the alarming drop in traffic cops on our roads.
""We urge the government to make roads policing a national policing priority to prevent illegal, risk-taking behaviour behind the wheel.""
The RAC said that while the numbers had ""fallen off a cliff"", the figures laid bare the lack of policing.
The breakdown organisation's road safety spokesman, Pete Williams, said: ""The simple truth is the problem of illegal handheld phone use at the wheel is undeniably getting worse, with fewer and fewer people being caught.""
Recent research from the RAC found the number of drivers who think it is acceptable to make a quick call doubled from 7% in 2014 to 14% in 2016.
Mr Williams said mobile phone usage at the wheel was an ""epidemic that has been allowed to sweep across the country largely unchallenged"".
""Attitudes are clearly relaxing as a result of drivers no longer fearing punishment,"" he added.
According to the Department of Transport, 22 people were killed in the UK last year by motorists using their phones whilst driving, and 684 people were injured.
In September, the government set out plans for new rules to come in next year, under which drivers will get six points on their licence and face a Â£200 fine for using their mobiles at the wheel.
While the enforcement of road traffic offences is a police matter, a government spokesperson said: ""We are clear that the illegal use of handheld devices while driving is totally unacceptable.
""We take this extremely seriously and will be shortly announcing tougher penalties for using mobile phones at the wheel.""
The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for roads policing, chief constable Suzette Davenport, said in recent years police forces have adopted new tactics, such as sending offenders on courses, rather than issuing fines, to learn about the impact and consequences of driving while distracted.
She said: ""While we are committed to policing these offences, we must also acknowledge that we cannot simply enforce away peoples' behaviour.
""We need to address not only the offences themselves but the attitudes which sit behind them.""
According to the NPCC, studies have shown that 68% of drivers who attend driver alertness courses stated that their driving habits had changed a great deal or quite a lot as a result.","The number of fines issued for using mobile phones while driving fell by 43% last year, official figures show."
166,"It was a chance to hear about the business practices of one of Britain's most unusual self-made men, who built Sports Direct from a single shop into a multi-billion pound business.
Jeffrey Blue, the investment banker who is suing Mr Ashley, claims that he promised to pay  a £15m bonus if the share price doubled to £8. This deal was allegedly struck during a boozy night at the Horse and Groom pub in London.
Mr Ashley cut a combative figure in the witness stand, frequently getting angry, and more than once accusing Mr Blue of being a liar.
But in addition to the hard-drinking culture described in Mr Blue's evidence, we got some fascinating insights into how Mr Ashley does business.
The Derbyshire village of Shirebrook is home to Sports Direct's vast warehouse, the scene of many allegations of exploitative working practices in the past. It's also the location of a vast office complex, arranged, Mr Blue claimed, around Mike Ashley's desk.
Mr Blue claimed that Mr Ashley had convened a ""senior management meeting"" in a pub, the Green Dragon, at the nearby village of Alfreton, which involved heavy drinking. It was at this pub that Mr Ashley allegedly drank twelve pints and vomited into the fireplace.
But Mr Ashley claimed that this was not a pub they usually attended.
""How many pubs was Sports Direct holding senior management meetings in?"" asked Jeffrey Chapman QC, Mr Blue's lawyer. But Mr Ashley denied they were management meetings, with agendas and minutes.
""It is very boring and lonely in Shirebrook,"" Mr Ashley said. ""You know what we do after work? We go to the pub after work.""
When asked to explain why the court had not been able to get hold of copies of his text messages at the time, Mr Ashley explained that he was not good at looking after phones.
""I did not have a mobile phone in my personal possession,"" he said.
""What has happened to your mobile phones during that period?"" Mr Blue's QC asked.
""I periodically lose my phone, destroy my phone, damage my phone... Whatever happens to phones happens to my phone."" And whenever one phone is out of action, he asks Sports Direct to give him another one.
At one time he said he had a box of about 50 phones in his office, though that number is now down to about 20.
""The IPO was an unmitigated disaster,"" he told the court.
The 2007 stock market debut, which saw Mr Ashley raise over £900m, happened because it was the best thing for the business, he said. It wasn't necessary for him to sell shares to raise money.
""I was already fabulously wealthy. What do you think I did with the money? Went out and bought the neighbour's house? I already owned it!""
The shares fell from £3 to less than 35p following the company's stock market launch, as investors became worried about Mr Ashley's unconventional management practices - including the time he played a game of ""spoof"" with the investment bankers who had organised the float.
One of the many times Mr Ashley became extremely animated in court was when asked to describe the moment when he played spoof with an investment banker to settle a dispute over £750,000 of legal fees connected with Sports Direct's flotation. Spoof is a game of chance popular in City circles.
""I had the opportunity to save Sports Direct £750,000!"" he said. ""I either had to pay or I could spoof for it.""
However, Mr Ashley lost the hand of spoof - and the fees were paid in full.
""Yes the City may laugh at me for the next 15 years, but yes - I would do it again in the morning!"" he said.
In his written statement, Mr Ashley called the fateful meeting at the Horse and Groom pub a ""fun night"". So much fun that the party went on to another venue, which he said he was too drunk to remember.
But in his oral evidence, he seemed less enthusiastic. ""I would rather have had needles in my eyes than go to that meeting,"" he said.
The meeting was convened to build relationships with investment bankers who were going to act for Sports Direct - and he had been invited along to impress the company's future brokers. It was ""like going to a school 'do' with your kids - absolutely horrendous"".
Other witnesses in the case who have worked for Mr Ashley spoke about his talents in reverential tones. But Mr Ashley himself was much more self-deprecating, about his reputation, his weight, and even his ability to write letters.
He said he discouraged staff from wheeling him out to charm people. He said they usually found it a letdown. They would say ""Jesus, is that it? We thought we would be meeting a bright bloke!""
""The other side will not be as impressed as you think they will be,"" he said.
Many of the questions directed at Mr Ashley referred to his level of control of the company - which, given that he owns more than half the shares, is not as complete as you might think. He denied sitting at the centre of the office ""stroking a white cat"" in the style of a Bond villain.
""I am not Obi Wan Kenobi controlling the Death Star, let's be clear"" he said. Obi Wan Kenobi has also denied controlling the Death Star - that was Darth Vader's department.

In the other game in England's pool, the United States cruised past Spain 43-0.
The Italians restricted England to a 29-15 win in the Six Nations earlier this year but they were no match for the Red Roses on Sunday.
Much like in their midweek thumping of Spain, England again produced plenty of classy moments but they also threw in a host of handling errors that prevented a thrashing turning into a rout.
The industrious flanker Marlie Packer was outstanding in attack and defence, one minute popping up to charge through the Italian defence near the fringes of the breakdown, the next winning a turnover at a ruck.
Rachael Burford prompted well in midfield and Katy Mclean pulled the strings effectively when she came on at 10 for the second half.
And when the ball went wide outside centre Scarratt and the lively back three of Waterman, Thompson and Wilson-Hardy all looked threatening and took the chance to add to their try tallies for England.
Their biggest concern may be the poor goal-kicking, with only three of the 10 tries converted as Scarratt, so assured in the rest of her game, left her kicking boots at home before handing over to Amber Reed.
England meet the United States in what will be a pool decider on Thursday, 17 August.
England captain Emily Scarratt speaking to ITV: ""It was a pretty good day. There's plenty to improve on now for a big game against the USA.

171,"They looked set to miss out because of riding bans which cover days on which there are races for amateur riders.
After the BBC helped raise a rules anomaly, they have won dispensation to ride at Aintree on 9 April.
However, with jockey bookings still to be finalised, it remains unclear whether they will actually line up.
""Owing to ambiguous wording of the rule, suspensions imposed on Sam Waley-Cohen and Nina Carberry will no longer apply on Grand National day,"" said a British Horseracing Authority statement.
""This decision follows a representation to this effect being made by Sam Waley-Cohen today.""
Waley-Cohen was banned for seven days following his ride on Long Run at Carlisle on Sunday, while Carberry had a similar suspension after her winning effort aboard On The Fringe at Cheltenham last week.
The suspensions apply on days where there are races for amateur riders.
There is a race for amateur riders on Grand National day, but it is also open to conditional jockeys, a point raised by the BBC and Waley-Cohen with officials at the BHA who now plan to make changes to the wording for next year to close the loophole.
""The clause relating to National Hunt flat races refers specifically to races confined to amateur riders and conditional jockeys, however the clause relating to hurdle races refers only to races confined to amateur riders,"" said a BHA spokesman.
""Having now identified the anomaly, the BHA will take steps to amend the schedule in future.""
The leading amateur jockey was suspended after he was adjudged to have prematurely stopped riding Long Run in the hunter chase at Carlisle on Sunday.
Stewards ruled 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run, who was retired after the race, could have finished third rather than fifth.
Waley-Cohen, 33, lost his appeal against the ban on Thursday but then raised the rules anomaly.
""It's been a bit of a roller-coaster of a day. From all the disappointment and everything else, the hope is now there. All I need now is a horse,"" he said.

Not in the pool, but on the pitch! It's a kind of cheating that's been a problem for years.
It's when players fall to the ground, pretending they've been fouled.

173,"BBC Newsnight has learned that the party's current deputy director of communications, Richard N Jackson, complained about Mark Clarke during elections for the party's youth wing.
Mr Jackson was among a number of activists who submitted complaints about Mr Clarke, seven years before another young party supporter, Elliott Johnson, took his own life after claiming he had been bullied by Mr Clarke.
The Conservative Party insists that complaints made in 2008 were ""dealt with properly"". Mr Clarke has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.
The party's chairman, Lord Feldman, has consistently maintained he was ""wholly unaware"" of bullying allegations against Mr Clarke before a slew of complaints were made in August 2015.
A party spokesperson would not say on Thursday night when Lord Feldman first became aware of the 2008 complaints, including one made by his own deputy communications chief.
Newsnight has also obtained a 2008 email to Mr Jackson which alleges that Mr Clarke was ""encouraging bullying"" of candidates standing against one of his allies in a Conservative Future election.
It claimed he had been offering ""preferential treatment"" to people who supported his ally. The bullying behaviour, which the complaint said Mr Clarke was encouraging, included mocking ""personal aspects of the candidates such as their appearance"".
It is understood Mr Jackson submitted this complaint, as well as one of his own, to Roger Pratt, then head of discipline at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ).
Newsnight has also learned that a file on Mr Clarke was kept by CCHQ before 2009 and this file contained at least one more serious bullying allegation relating to a young woman.
A CCHQ spokesperson on Thursday night confirmed that Mr Jackson had made a complaint, and said all historic complaints against Mr Clarke were properly dealt with.
Since Elliott Johnson took his life in September, leaving a letter naming Mr Clarke, the Conservative Party has been engulfed by claims that it failed to act properly on complaints about bullying behaviour by Mr Clarke.
On 18 November the party issued a statement saying: ""We have been checking and rechecking, but have not been able to find any records of complaints that were made but not dealt with - but we are determined to get to the bottom of what's happened.""
The party maintained on Thursday night that this denial referred only to allegations about Mr Clarke during the period between 2014 and 2015 when he ran RoadTrip, a CCHQ backed organisation which bussed young volunteers to campaign in target seats.
One of the activists who complained about Mr Clarke in 2008 was Patrick Sullivan, who now runs a Conservative supporting think tank.
Mr Sullivan told Newsnight on Tuesday that a ""dossier"" of allegations against a number of activists, including Mr Clarke, was later handed to Tory chairman Lord Feldman in 2010 by the MP Ben Howlett.
The party has vigorously denied that any such document existed, maintaining that it cannot find a record of it, and that neither Lord Feldman nor his then co-chair, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, can remember it.
Mr Sullivan told Newsnight: ""We would very much like more victims to speak out and explain what has happened. I understand how difficult it is to come forward and they are afraid. But unless a light is shone on this culture of bullying it will just continue.""
""Politics doesn't only attract confident people,"" he continued. ""It also attracts vulnerable people looking for a sense of belonging. Those people need to be taken care of and treated well.  And the Conservative Party does have a duty of care - any party does - to its activists.""

175,"Students at California State University have been urged to contact university police immediately if they are approached by immigration officials.
Several US universities are trying to resist potential student deportations - some using the term ""sanctuary campus"".
Mr Trump has announced tougher enforcement of immigration rules.
Former President Barack Obama focused on deporting only immigrants convicted of serious crimes, those considered threats to national security or those who had arrived recently.
Mr Trump's administration issued memos this week expanding the list of undocumented immigrants prioritised for ""expedited removal"".
Supporters say enforcing the law discourages further illegal immigration, which they say is too high and threatens security.
What is life like in sanctuary cities since Trump came to power?
Is arrest of a 'dreamer' a sign of things to come?
Has Trump started a new deportation drive?
Wednesday's memorandum from CSU Chancellor Timothy White said the university would ""continue to make every lawful effort to provide a safe and welcoming campus environment for all of our students"", which, it says, include some who lack immigration documentation.
There has been continued concern about 750,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US illegally as children, known as Dreamers.
Their deportation proceedings were deferred under the Obama administration programme known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca).
Mr Trump's presidential campaign website said he planned to ""immediately terminate"" the programme.
But since coming into office he has said he finds the subject ""very, very tough"" and intends to show ""great heart"" in dealing with what he described as, in many cases, ""incredible kids"".
The Department for Homeland Security made it clear on Tuesday that the new memos on enforcement do not affect Daca, but gave no detail on the programme's future.
Mr White's memo said some undocumented students at CSU do not even have Daca status.
He stressed the university would not help law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration laws.
""Our university police departments will not honour immigration hold requests, and our university police will not contact, detain, question, or arrest individuals solely on the basis of being - or suspected of being - a person who lacks documentation,"" he wrote.
The CSU memo comes as students at Florida State University voted to request their university declare itself a ""sanctuary campus"".
Dozens of universities have come under pressure from students to follow the model of ""sanctuary cities"" - jurisdictions which have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries.
Officials in these designated areas, including local law enforcement, are not allowed to inquire about an individual's immigration status in the course of their duties.
Wesleyan University in Connecticut declared itself a sanctuary campus in November, saying it would ""not voluntarily assist in any efforts by the federal government to deport our students, faculty or staff solely because of their citizenship status"".
But others have steered clear of the term, arguing it has no clear definition.
Also on Wednesday, the lower house of the state legislature in the state of Georgia approved a measure that would cut off funding to colleges failing to comply with President Trump's immigration policy.
""Not to put too fine a point on it, there is no sanctuary from the law,"" Republican Rep Earl Ehrhart, who introduced the measure, was quoted by local media as saying.","A California university has issued advice aimed at protecting undocumented students, as the Trump administration ramps up deportations."

The 180ft-tall (55m) giant, cut into the hillside above the Dorset village of Cerne Abbas, is regarded by some as a symbol of fertility.
Mr Griffiths said: ""The beer pump has the famous chalk man on the front of it and he is particularly well-endowed.

Mr Rajab was arrested in April and charged with insulting public institutions on Twitter.
Bahrain's Sunni Muslim rulers forcibly quelled a 2011 uprising which had been triggered in large part by unrest among Shias.
Mr Rajab also fell foul of the authorities in September after suggesting in a tweet that security institutions in Bahrain served as an ""ideological incubator"" for jihadists.
Human rights groups described his arrest and conviction as developments which should give the US pause for thought as it considered whether to lift restrictions on sending arms to the kingdom.

It said outstanding issues with the rights of commoners must be resolved before a formal decision was made.
The Heads of the Valleys Development Company (HOTVDC) welcomed the move.
The development comes after a public inquiry in March examined the firm's request to take over 250 hectares (600 acres) of common land.
The HOTVDC said the latest announcement from Rebecca Evans, the deputy minister for farming and food, meant it could now exercise agreements already in place with commoners, which includes providing replacement land.

The European Union's General Court has now upheld the decision.
The Court said that all sounds could constitute a trademark if they were represented graphically, as the Grupo Globo one was.

Mr Rajoy rejected opposition calls for his resignation after a newspaper published images of documents allegedly showing secret payments to PP members.
He said the claims were ""totally false"" and denied receiving illegal money.
Speaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Mr Rajoy said his government remained strong and would overcome the accusations, which have sparked protests and an online petition for his resignation signed by 850,000 people.
""The government is stable. The PP has a majority,"" Mr Rajoy said. ""It's carrying out its agenda based on reforms.""
Mrs Merkel said Germany would support the Spanish government's efforts.

But Spain's benchmark Ibex share index dropped 2.86% late on Monday amid worries about the corruption scandal and its potential implications.
However, there was some speculation in Spanish media that Mr Rajoy, in one of his answers at the press conference, appeared to have admitted that some of what the El Pais newspaper published was correct.
Asked about the payments, he said: ""Everything that refers to me, and that appears there, and to some of my fellow party members that appear there, is not right, except for something that the media has published.""
The central claim is that documents published by El Pais are a list of undeclared or secret cash payments linked to senior PP members.
By Tom BurridgeBBC News, Madrid
Unsurprisingly, this was one of the toughest press conferences Mariano Rajoy has faced since becoming prime minister.
When he made his public statement at his party's headquarters in Madrid on Saturday, there were no questions from journalists, who had to follow via video-link from a separate room.
Everyone knew that at a press conference, following a bilateral meeting with Angel Merkel, questions were par for the course.
The fact that German journalists directed questions to Mr Rajoy on the subject shows that the scandal has taken on international significance. There is no sign that he might step down but, rightly or wrongly, his credibility is being questioned.
Mr Rajoy gave calm and measured replies, once again calling the allegations against him and his party false. The PP are now on the offensive, threatening legal action against those responsible for what they claim are cooked-up allegations.
But the fallout from the documents published by El Pais is still firmly on the domestic news agenda, dominating the headlines in Spain.
Until 2007, Spanish political parties were allowed to receive anonymous donations.
El Pais is adamant that the ledgers, dating from 1990 to 2008, were written by the party's former treasurer, Luis Barcenas who stepped down after being implicated in a separate, high-profile corruption case.
Mariano Rajoy's name is written a number of times in the documents. Alongside his name are numbers totalling 25,200 euros for each year, from 1999 to 2008.
On Saturday, two days after the documents were published, the prime minister publicly denied ever having received any secret payments.
He said the allegations against him and his party were false.
Spain's chief prosecutor has said there could be enough evidence to investigate the allegations. but the PP has said it will take legal action against those responsible for what it says is a smear campaign, while announcing an internal audit of its finances.
The leader of Spain's main opposition party, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, has called for the prime minister to resign, but the BBC's Tom Burridge in Madrid says that as things stand, that looks unlikely. The prime minister has said he will publish his earnings online.
Spaniards have been asked to accept painful austerity measures as the government battles to avoid an international bailout. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has reached a record 26%.
Small crowds of demonstrators took to the streets in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville on Saturday evening calling on Mr Rajoy to step down, with clashes with police in the capital.","Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy has fiercely denied corruption allegations, pledging that Spain will see off its worst financial crisis in recent years."

Marr will oversee a series of readings illustrating how poetry of the past reflects the issues of today.
""Ripping up Radio 4's schedules for National Poetry Day seemed a rather bold and brilliant thing to do,"" said the broadcaster in a statement.
Poems selected for the day-long project include Walter Raleigh's The Lie, which rails against corruption in the church and state; and William Dunbar's Lament for the Makars, a roll-call of deceased poets, starting with Chaucer.
The works of William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Christina Rossetti and Ted Hughes will also feature, as well as verses from less familiar figures such as Anne Askew and Anne Bradstreet, and anonymous writers of medieval ballads.
""I can't remember British history being told, in this way, through the directness of poetry,"" said Marr.
""But if we want to get a real sense of what life was like in early medieval England, or how people felt about the plague or the fanaticism of the wars of religion; or the trauma of the slow decline of religion during the arrival of science, then the witness offered by great poetry is a very good way in.
""If there is a single art which the people of these islands have excelled at, beyond all others, it is surely poetry.""
Among those joining Marr to read and discuss the poems will be Charles Dance, Harriett Walter, and poets Gillian Clarke, Michael Rosen and Daljit Nagra.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls accused Mr Montebourg of crossing ""a yellow line"" and announced the resignation of his entire cabinet.
The move had apparently been agreed with President Francois Hollande, who immediately asked him to form a new government on Tuesday ""consistent with the direction"" he had set for the country.
France is struggling with high unemployment and low growth and President Francois Hollande's popularity is the lowest for a president in more than 50 years.
Mr Montebourg told a news conference later on Monday he thought it necessary to speak out to try to avert the European Union's ""descent into hell"".

Hollande purges rebels - Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris
Francois Hollande is sending a clear message: dissenters within the party will not be tolerated at this difficult economic moment.
But the decision to dissolve the government is also a sign of how much is at stake for him.
With unemployment running at more than 10%, growth stagnant, and polls suggesting that less than 20% of voters think he can turn the economy around, Mr Hollande is facing a difficult autumn.
His plan has been to cut spending in order to fund tax cuts for business, in the hope of boosting the economy, but there are those in his party who disagree.
They want less focus on austerity, and more money funnelled direct to households. Purging the rebels is an eye-catching move, but with his popularity at an all-time low, Mr Hollande cannot afford to look weak.
Mr Montebourg, 51, is on the left wing of the governing Socialist party, and has campaigned against globalisation.
He came third in the party's contest for presidential candidate in 2011.
He told Le Monde newspaper that Germany was trapped in an austerity policy that it had imposed across Europe and spoke at a meeting with Mr Hamon in eastern France on Sunday, with the support of Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti.
Mr Hamon called on Sunday for a revival in demand, and for an end to German Chancellor Angela Merkel setting Europe's direction.

September 2003 was the last time the Doonhamers secured an away victory against St Mirren and there was no success in this eighth attempt at taking three points from Paisley.
It was on the half-hour mark when substitute Brownlee was dispossessed by Shankland and sent the on-loan Aberdeen striker tumbling as shaped to shoot.
Referee Alan Muir pointed to the spot and Mallan despatched the penalty low into the bottom left corner.
Prior to that, Queens had hit the crossbar from Kyle Jacobs' cross-come-shot but another of his deliveries helped bring the visitors level after the break.
Oliver popped up at the back post to nod in his third of the season - all the harder to take for Saints given they had just had a Shankland goal ruled out for offside moments before.
But a minute after Oliver's leveller, St Mirren regained the lead.

Victims include detainees, journalists and human rights activists. Scores of people have been tortured and killed.
Libya, fragmented since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, now has rival militia-backed parliaments.
There are hundreds of different armed groups and the chaos has allowed so-called Islamic State to gain a foothold.
The report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Libya describes a country descending into violent chaos.
Other tactics documented in the report include indiscriminate attacks on civilians, rape and other sexual violence.
This is all happening in a climate of ""complete impunity"", the report says, made worse because Libya's justice system has collapsed.
The crimes are committed by ""a multitude of actors - both state and non-state"".
The UN says the report is the most comprehensive to be carried out in Libya in recent years.
Interviews were carried with hundreds of people inside the country and with Libyans forced to flee to Italy, Tunisia and Egypt.
The report lists in detail:
The report says that evidence of sexual violence is difficult to document because of fear of retaliation, stigma, family pressure or trauma.
It says that the plight of children, migrants, human rights defenders and journalists has been made worse by ""the systemic failures of the justice system"".
The UN says the international criminal court should be able to carry out investigations and prosecutions, and protection programmes should be set up for victims and witnesses.
It also calls on the UN Security Council to consider economic sanctions against Libyans found responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.","Killings and torture are being committed with impunity by all sides in Libya, according to a UN report."

The Irish Republic passed a similar law earlier this month and Australia has had plain packaging since 2012.
Health campaigners said they were ""delighted"" with the move.
Some 367 MPs voted in favour of standardised packaging with 113 against it in a free vote.
It comes after a long battle to get to this point. The government announced in 2011 it would be considering standardised packaging and ran a consultation in 2012.
But ministers then appeared to go cool on the plan, prompting accusations it had been influenced by the tobacco industry, before another review of the public health benefits was ordered.
That review was carried out by by paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler and concluded last year it was very likely the change would lead to a modest but important reduction in the uptake and prevalence of smoking.
More than 600 children aged 11 to 15 start to smoke every day - more than 200,000 a year. The review said if that number could be cut even by 2%, 4,000 fewer would take up the habit.
Research has shown standardised packaging makes the packets less appealing and helps reinforce health messages.
Darker colours - olive green is proposed - are favoured ahead of white, as they are perceived to signify more harm.
British Lung Foundation chief executive Dr Penny Woods said she was ""delighted"" with the result.
""We now look to the House of Lords to give this legislation the final parliamentary stamp of approval. The moment tobacco companies are finally denied the right to use glitzy packaging to recruit new smokers will be a moment of celebration for those who care about public health.""
Meanwhile, the campaign group, Action on Smoking and Health, called it the ""most important public health reform of this Parliament"".
But the Tobacco Manufacturer's Association has argued there is a ""complete lack of evidence that the policy will work"".
Simon Clark, of the smokers lobby group Forest, said: ""Consumers are fed up being patronised by politicians of all parties. Smokers know there are health risks associated with tobacco. Plain packaging won't make any difference.
""What next? Standardised packaging for alcohol and sugary drinks?""
While the vote in favour had been widely expected, concerns were raised about how the process had been handled.
Powers for standardising packaging were in the Children and Families Act 2014 and were agreed by a committee earlier this week.
But as it is not primary legislation, there was no need for a debate and so the vote was done via a paper ballot.
Conservative MP Nick De Bois said: ""I certainly would never have expected to see this measure before this House this late in the parliament, announced in an adjournment debate without the benefit of a full debate.""
While the vote was on the introduction of the regulations in England, the other parts of the UK had already committed to introducing standardised packaging if MPs passed it.",MPs have voted in favour of introducing standardised packaging for cigarettes in the UK.
190,"They also  
          posed for pictures
 with torchbearers Scott Moorhouse and Jay Kamiraz, whose Souls of Prophecy choir is a favourite of the prince.
England's World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks started the day's relay, carrying the flame at Wembley Stadium.
Decathlete Daley Thompson ran the last leg of the relay at Alexandra Palace.
Thompson,  
          who won decathlon gold at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles,
 lit a cauldron on stage in the climax to Wednesday's 30-mile journey.
A total of 153 torchbearers carried the flame as it travelled 30 miles through the London boroughs of Harrow, Brent, Barnet, Enfield and Haringey.
It was in the last of the boroughs, at 1726 BST, that  
          Prince Charles and Camilla appeared on the side of the road
 as Mr Kamiraz came to the end of his run and passed on the flame.
The royal couple then stood either side of the torchbearers while photographs were taken before Mr Moorhouse, an amputee who lost his left leg at the knee after an accident when he was six weeks old, began his stint with the flame.
The first torchbearer of the day was Jo Hyams, 29, who took the flame across the bridge and moat at Headstone Manor, a grade I-listed building, reputed to be the oldest surviving timber-framed construction in Middlesex.

Ms Hyams, who lives in Harrow, was nominated for her charity work in the area.
Later as the flame neared Wembley Stadium, Timothy McKenzie, better known as singer songwriter Labrinth, ran with the flame.
Singer Beverley Knight was also a torchbearer in Brent.
Outside the stadium, Inderjit Bhalla - who won gold in badminton at the British Transplant Games - passed the flame to former badminton player Nathan Robertson, who won silver at the 2004 Athens Olympics with former mixed-doubles partner Gail Emms.
Robertson missed out on qualifying for London 2012 and has since  
          announced his retirement from the sport.
England's greatest goalkeeper, Banks, then ensured the torch was in safe hands as he carried it along Olympic Way outside the new stadium.
Now 75, he was part of England's famous team that won the World Cup in 1966 at the original stadium, and he also played in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, when England reached the quarter-finals.
He said his stint with the torch was ""absolutely fantastic"".
He added it was ""a great honour to have been here and held the torch with a light on it that goes back so many, many, many years"".
Banks also paid tribute to his former team-mates, the late Alan Ball and Bobby Moore.
The flame was carried to the lunch break by  
          100-year-old Diana Gould,
 the oldest female torchbearer of London 2012. She still runs exercise classes at the retirement flats where she lives in north-west London.
Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint, 23, was the first to carry the flame after lunch.
""It's something I'm finding hard to put into words - an overwhelming blur of an experience [that] I'm going to remember for ever,"" he said.
The actor, who plays Ron Weasley in the films, handed over to Harriet Cooper, who at 15 is considered an outstanding swimming prospect, having won gold at the 100m backstroke in the 2011 European Youth Olympic Festival in Turkey.
Still on the swimming theme, among the other torchbearers was Tony Tancock, father of British Olympic hopeful Liam, who will be competing in the 100m backstroke.
Boxer James Degale, who won a  
          middleweight gold medal at the 2008 Olympics
 in Beijing, soldier Jack Otter, who lost both legs and an arm in an explosion in Afghanistan, and Lloyd Scott, from Essex, who survived leukaemia, were among the other torchbearers.
Mr Otter in particular drew huge cheers from the crowd as he twice got up from his wheelchair to walk unaided during the first and last parts of his stint.
The relay finished at Alexandra Palace, where 68-year-old Frank Adams passed the flame to Thompson, who was the first decathlete to hold the World, Olympic, Commonwealth and European titles simultaneously.
Thompson, who trained at nearby Haringey Athletics Club, looked thrilled when he did the honours at ""Ally Pally"", formerly the BBC's headquarters and still a major events venue.
A total of 8,000 people will carry the flame during its 8,000 mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July.",Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visited the torch relay in Tottenham where they watched a torch kiss from the side of the street.
191,"The fake site uses pictures of Newcastle University buildings and takes payments for a non-existent ""Newcastle International University"".
It is ""in no way associated with the university"", warns the university's official Twitter feed.
Students should avoid accessing the site, the university advises.
The site has been described as unusually realistic, but Newcastle International University does not appear on the government's official lists of degree providers in the UK.
Azeem Aleem, director of advanced cyber-defence practice at RSA security's Europe Middle East and Africa region, said: ""Make no mistake, this is an effective scam.
""They've put in the time and effort to create a remarkably realistic website, and it highlights the very real danger of modern spoofing attacks.""
Mr Aleem said the fake site carefully targets overseas students ""who may not have the local knowledge to spot the difference between this site and Newcastle University's official site"".
He praised Newcastle University for a swift response once the fraudulent site was reported to them earlier this week.
Kirsten Edmondson, head of digital at the university, said the scam came to light when a prospective international student tweeted a question about it.
Ms Edmondson said she was particularly concerned that the site asks for passport numbers and credit card information.
""We would never ask for these details as part of an application,"" said Ms Edmondson.
Handing them over on this site would leave prospective students at risk of identity theft and losing their money and not receiving any education in return, she added.
She said it was impossible to say whether anyone had handed over personal information - but investigations have shown that the site has been active since 7 July and new features have been added even since it was discovered.
She is particularly concerned that the site is targeting agencies who help pair overseas students with suitable UK courses.
In a statement, Newcastle University said it had reported the site to the internet hosting company and to the internet standards organisation ICANN as well as to the police.
""We proactively announced on social media that this is a fraudulent website and have responded to some student enquiries and will continue to do so. We would urge any students not to access this site and go to our official site: www.ncl.ac.uk or call the university's general number if they have any queries.""
Universities UK said fraudulent websites had become less common following international crackdowns.
""It can be difficult for international students to know whether a university advert or link is genuine, so we would advise any prospective students who are not sure to check the official list which includes links to their websites,"" said UUK in a statement.",Newcastle University is warning prospective students not to give out personal details on a fraudulent website taking payments for courses.

He contacted a metal detecting club who used their equipment to search the lakebed when it was drained last week.
Mr Walker said he would be ""eternally grateful"" to them for finding the white gold band, which is engraved with the date of the couple's anniversary.
He said: ""I was swimming with the kids and when I climbed up onto a raft, I realised I had lost my ring.
""I was absolutely devastated to have lost it but the water there is so murky, there was no chance of finding it.""
The ""Somerset Artifact Seekers"" - which helps people search for lost items - discovered the ring in the silt.
Volunteer Dave Baker said: ""It took us about an hour of looking before I was minded to go over to the pontoon and then within seconds I found it.
""We do it because of that face they get when they see the item that they thought was lost forever returned to them- it is absolutely phenomenal.""
Mr Walker previously lost the ring in a harbour in Cornwall, although was able to rescue it as the water was clear and it was easy to spot.
He said: ""It's pretty careless of me really, I will need to get it made smaller.""
His wife of 13 years, Rachel, added: ""When my son told me Matt had lost the ring I thought he was having me on.
""I would have had a go at him as I always take my ring off when I swim, but he was really upset.

193,"There were 184 rape allegations in 2014, up from 33 in 2009, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.
It said 85% of the rape victims were women and of these, 42% were aged 20 to 29 and 24% were between 40 and 49.
The agency said it was concerned the number may be under-reported, and it encouraged victims to come forward.
More than nine million people in the UK have signed up to dating websites.
Sean Sutton of the NCA's Serious Crime Analysis Section said further work was needed to understand the increase, but the team was considering whether this could include:
""This initial work clearly raises a lot of questions and we will be working with academia to build a more complete picture,"" Mr Sutton said.
""Our aim here is to make people aware of the potential danger, so they can be better prepared and make the choices that are right for them.
""A rape victim is never at fault and we do not want the circumstances in which these assaults take place to cause any victim to doubt that.
""Sexual assault is a crime, full stop, and we want victims to feel confident reporting it to the police.""
1. Plan it. Say it. Do it - It is your date. Agree on what you both want from it before you meet up. Do not feel pressured to meet before you are ready or for any longer than you are comfortable with - a short first date is fine.
2. Meet in public - Stay in public. The safest plan is to meet somewhere public and stay somewhere public. Make your own way there and back and do not feel pressured to go home with your date. If you feel ready to move to a private environment, make sure your expectations match your date's.
3. Get to know the person, not the profile - The way people interact online is not always the same face-to-face. Do not be offended if your date is more guarded when meeting in person or if things do not progress as fast face-to-face.
4. Not going well? Make your excuses and leave - Do not feel bad about cutting a date short if you are not keen. You do not owe the other person anything, no matter how long you have been chatting or what has been suggested.
5. If you are raped or sexually assaulted on your date, help is available - Contact Rape Crisis or The Survivors Trust for more information and advice.

Earlier this month, security firm Symantec warned that almost half of people using dating sites or apps had been scammed or spammed.
It said daters fell victim to blackmail, were subjected to revenge porn and were tricked by people who assumed fake identities to steal cash.","The number of people reporting being raped by someone they met on a dating app or website has risen six-fold in five years, official figures show."

195,"The 62-36 vote comes after weeks of debate and votes to amend the bill after the House approved it.
The 875-mile (1,400km) pipeline would carry tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada, to the US state of Nebraska where it joins pipes running to Texas.
The White House has previously said Mr Obama will veto the bill.
Spokesman Josh Earnest said the legislation would undermine a ""well-established"" review process.
Congress would need two-thirds of each chamber of Congress to overcome a presidential veto.
The project has pitted Republicans and other supporters, who say it will create much needed jobs, against many Democrats and environmentalists, who warn the pipeline will add to carbon emissions and contribute to global warming.
Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell called the bill ""an important accomplishment for the country"".
""We are hoping the president upon reflection will agree to sign on to a bill that the State Department said could create up to 42,000 jobs and the State Department said creates little to no impact on the environment.""
Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer called the bill ""a disgrace"".
""We tried on our side to make this a better bill and they turned us away.""
Among the measures added the bill during the amendment process were energy efficiency measures, as well as on-the-record acknowledgement that climate change was not hoax.
The US president has been critical of the pipeline, saying at the end of last year it would primarily benefit Canadian oil firms and not contribute much to already dropping petrol prices.
A State Department report raised no major environmental objections in February, but the final recommendation was delayed amid a court battle over the project in Nebraska.
A final decision is expected in the upcoming weeks.
The state department is involved because the pipeline would cross an international border.
The Keystone XL pipeline aims to carry some 830,000 barrels of heavy crude a day from the fields in Alberta to Nebraska.
The oil would then be transported on existing pipes to refineries in Texas. The southern section of the project was finished last year.","The US Senate has passed a bill to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, sending it to President Barack Obama's desk for a likely veto."

The ""exploitative"" men filmed the abuse and used it to threaten their victims, police said.
Turner, of Davidson Road, Old Swan, and Bell, of Makin Street, Walton, were each sentenced 12 years in jail.
Andrew Ford, prosecuting, said Turner filmed the 16-year-old having sex while there were other men in the room.
Both men were found guilty of two counts of having sexual activity with a child and two counts of inciting a child into sexual activity.
Turner admitted four counts of taking indecent images of a child, involving filming degrading videos of the 16-year-old girl.
Judge Anil Murray said they had used the younger girl ""for your own sexual gratification for 15 months"", treating her as a ""sexual plaything"" without a ""care for her feelings.""

Chief executive Liz Cameron warned that the UK economy remained vulnerable to external shocks.
She was speaking as the Conservatives sealed election victory.
The party has already undertaken to hold a referendum on membership of the EU during the next parliament.
Ms Cameron said: ""It is now vital that the business of government resumes quickly.
""Our economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, such as the continuing Greek bailout saga and a slowdown in a number of our international target markets.
""What we don't need is extended uncertainty over our future membership of the European Union.""
She added: ""This market is worth £12.9bn to Scotland's exporters and the European question needs to be settled quickly and decisively.
""Here in Scotland, the election has produced a very different result to the rest of the UK, but business and our economy should remain the central driver.

Director Hugh Aitken added: ""Businesses will want to see the SNP keep its focus on policies that help make Scotland more competitive, like building more new homes, keeping the UK in a reformed EU and extending the Annual Investment Allowance.
""Getting the deficit down must be a priority, to maintain the UK's credibility in international markets which will keep the cost of borrowing down for growing Scottish businesses.""
The Federation of Small Businesses congratulated the SNP on what it called ""a truly stunning result"", after the party won 56 out of 59 seats in Scotland.
Scottish policy convener Andy Willox said: ""No matter the scale of the political sea-change, though, the big issues facing the class of 2015 remain the same: sorting out the economy, securing the recovery and backing business to create jobs and raise revenues.
""On a UK level, the fact that we have a clear winner means we are spared the threatened weeks of political wrangling and horse-trading.
""That means the new government can get straight on with delivering on the issues that matter most to Scotland's small businesses: ending the scandal of late payment; developing a more competitive banking market; and ensuring that big energy firms treat our members fairly.""","Scottish business leaders have called for the issue of Britain's membership of the European Union to be settled ""quickly and decisively"" in the wake of the general election result."
