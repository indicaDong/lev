0,"Vigilante groups armed with high-powered weapons of questionable origin have pushed out a powerful drug cartel, the Knights Templar, from some of their key footholds in a region called Tierra Caliente.
As the retreating drug cartel members fled towards the town of Apatzingan, they burned lorries and set up roadblocks along the main highway.
Meanwhile the army, sent in to restore order and disarm the self-defence forces in the town of Antunez, opened fire, killing at least two villagers.
There have also been repeated arson attacks in Apatzingan, presumably by drug gang members, right under the noses of the scores of military personnel and federal police patrolling the city.
""This is a failed state,"" says Comandante Cinco, a self-defence leader in the village of Paracuaro.
He says the community militias emerged because people were tired of paying extortion money to the drug cartels while local police did nothing to protect them.
Worse still, many officers were in the pay of the cartel.
The streets of Paracuaro are now firmly in the vigilantes' hands. Young men who until recently picked lemons and avocados for a living are getting acquainted with their new handguns and automatic rifles.
The entire village has turned out in the main square to hear the self-defence forces explain their plan for the future now that the cartel have been run out of town.
Some townsfolk are fearful of simply replacing one group of unknown armed men with another. Other people are holding up placards thanking the self-defence forces for taking on the Knights Templar.
On stage, Comandante Cinco gets straight to the point:
""The self-defence forces are not paramilitaries,"" he shouts to applause from the crowd. ""You are all self-defence members too!""
Q&A: Mexico's drug-related violence
But while the vigilantes undoubtedly enjoy public support in the region of Tierra Caliente for the time being, the question now is whether they will be prepared to give up their weapons when the time comes.
Comandante Cinco insists that will happen sooner rather than later.
""At the rate we're going, I think that in two months we will have cleared the state of Knights Templar and we'll all go home.""
""We've only been here for ten days and already people feel free, businesses are returning to normal. In two months, the state of Michoacan will be clean.""
For most, though, that is an optimistic estimate.
In Apatzingan most shops are staying closed until the tension eases a little. The economy in the town, as well as elsewhere in Michoacan, is taking a battering.
Meanwhile the church now has entered the fray. The Bishop of Apatzingan, Miguel Patino, has also previously described the state as failed. Now he has published an open letter criticising the government's response to the crisis.
""The problem we have is that often we can't find any guarantee of security among our local authorities because they are compromised by the enemies of peace,"" the bishop told the BBC in the cathedral in Apatzingan.
""That's a serious problem because who can we turn to?""
On Wednesday, the Mexican government appointed a new security chief for the state, Alfredo Castillo, tasked with the unenviable mission of restoring stability.
The government of President Enrique Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied that it has lost its grip on Michoacan despite several troop surges in the state in the year since he came to office.
Speaking to the BBC shortly before the latest crisis unfolded, the head of the federal police, Francisco Galindo Ceballos, rejected the bishop's description of the western state as ""failed"".
""The government of Michoacan is in place. It's stable. It's governing. The municipal governments and the mayors are working too.
""So I don't share this point of view that the state has been lost.""
His opinion is unlikely to have changed much since this latest push by the self-defence forces, as the Pena Nieto administration is trying to show a united front on what is a highly complex situation.
For most citizens caught in the stand-off, the question of whether or not the state has failed is perhaps academic. Certainly, they see it as failing.
In his open letter, the Bishop of Apatzingan asked rhetorically: ""Can't [the army and the government] see we're in a state of need?""
Whether he meant in need of security, in need of peace or in need of a respite from the fighting, most of his parishioners would agree.","Michoacan, the Mexican state where troops were first deployed in 2007 to tackle the drug gangs, is in danger of spiralling out of control."
1,"Officers detained a 33-year-old man in a street in the capital on Thursday afternoon and he is being held at a central London police station.
He is being questioned on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Police have been searching two houses.
Officers said his arrest was pre-planned and was as a result of an investigation by the MPS Counter Terrorism Command supported by the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit.
There was police activity in the Grangetown and Riverside areas of Cardiff on Thursday afternoon but Metropolitan Police refused to confirm if it was linked to the arrest.
The BBC understands the arrest is related to alleged Islamist terrorism.","The arrest of a man on suspicion of terrorism offences in Cardiff relates to a possible attack in the UK, police have indicated."
2,"The left-wing Farabundo Marti Liberation Liberation Front (FMLN) wants to allow abortion in cases of rape, risk to the mother's life or if the foetus is unviable.
The practice is currently completely banned in El Salvador.
The FMLN will need the support of an extra 12 lawmakers to pass the bill.
The bill was backed by the president of Congress, Lorena Pena, who proposed that women whose life was at risk or those who had been raped or trafficked be allowed to end their pregnancy.
""It's a duty of legislators to give women a chance to save their lives, so that they don't die in those circumstances. It [the bill] is also meant to take into account the impact giving birth has on girls who have been raped,"" she said.
Opposition lawmaker Ricardo Velasquez Parker said the FMLN's proposal was an attempt to divert attention away from the financial problems of he government, which is facing a massive deficit.
Mr Velasquez backs a rival bill which would have abortion punished with up to 50 years in jail, the same as aggravated murder.
Under current Salvadorean law, anyone who is found to have ""provoked, allowed or carried out an abortion"" can be sentenced to between two and eight years in prison.
El Salvador is not the only Latin American country with a strict abortion ban. Chile, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Nicaragua also do not allow abortions under any circumstances.",Rape victims in El Salvador may be allowed to have abortions under proposals put forward by the governing party.
3,"SP Energy Networks wants to build a new line from South Ayrshire to Cumbria - most of it in Dumfries and Galloway.
It has now published its report on public feedback on the plans.
It said a further round of consultation would be required later this year but said changes in the industry could affect the ""scope of the project"".
More than 1,600 pieces of feedback were provided during the first round of consultation - the majority from Dumfries and Galloway where most of the proposed power line route would run.
A number of points about the scheme were raised, including:
The company said that since the consultation was launched, there had been a ""number of significant developments in the wider energy sector"" which could affect the project.
However, it said it remained the case that investment was required to replace ""ageing infrastructure in the Dumfries and Galloway region"".
There will now be ""further analysis"" to determine the extent to which changes to ""subsidy arrangements for onshore wind farms and the future mix of power generation in Scotland"" would alter their plans.
SP Energy Networks transmission director Pearse Murray said: ""In our initial documentation published last year, we indicated our intention to undertake a second round of consultation in 2016 on the preferred routes and substation sites.
""Given the further analysis work we are doing with National Grid, we believe it is necessary to take more time to consider the issues in order to ensure that the most appropriate proposal is taken forward to the next stage of the process.
""Once we have the results of the studies that are under way, we will be in a position to set out any implications on the scope of the project and our plans for the next round of consultation.
""We expect that this will be in the summer of this year.""
Alan Jones, of campaign group Dumgal Against Pylons, said it welcomed the recognition that ""external factors"" had changed since the consultation was launched.
""While we have always recognised the need to replace the existing system because of its age, and add some future-proofing, this 'pause for thought' aligns with our thinking,"" he said.
""It will give Scottish Power the time they need to take into consideration not only the extensive feedback but also to reflect on how best to meet the changing external environmental circumstances.""
He added that a stakeholder liaison group for the project should now be expanded and also called for independent research on the potential impact of the scheme.",Significant changes in the energy industry could alter the scale and nature of plans for a major power line upgrade in southern Scotland.
4,"The New York attorney general has sent a request for emails and financial records to the company.
Allegations surfaced last month that the company's own scientists raised concerns about global warming decades ago and that Exxon had worked to suppress that information.
On Thursday, the company called the allegations ""inaccurate distortions"".
Exxon Mobil's vice-president for public affairs, Kenneth Cohen, said on Thursday, ""We unequivocally reject the allegations that Exxon Mobil has suppressed climate change research.""
The investigation centres on whether the company lied as recently as this year to investors about the risks of climate change raised by its own scientists.
Exxon was accused by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times of funding anti-climate change groups to mislead the public about the threat of global warming.
US presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both called for inquiries into Exxon actions.
Attorney generals from other US states may also join New York in investigating the company.",Oil giant Exxon Mobil is being investigated for misleading the public about the impact of climate change.
5,"The Dundee-born forward, 19, who starred for Scotland Under-20s in their recent win over England, has only started five matches for Edinburgh.
""I think he will play for Scotland, I have no doubt whatsoever,"" Solomons said. ""He is a terrific player.
""He is a good footballer, intelligent, has a fantastic work-rate and could definitely play six, seven or eight.""
Ritchie, who captained Scotland's Under-18 side, has profited in recent weeks from an injury to captain Mike Coman - who is leaving at the end of the season to join London Irish.
The teenager was contracted straight from Perth's Strathallan School last season into Edinburgh's senior squad, and starts his fifth game out of six on Friday against Pro 12 leaders Connacht at Murrayfield.
""I am really enjoying the opportunity to play,"" he said. ""The exposure has done a lot for my confidence.
""I don't find myself getting quite as nervous now. I feel more confident in my role and knowing I can cope physically at this level.""
Ritchie may only have 12 senior games on his CV, but he is happy to contemplate the prospect of a Scotland call-up.
""Hopefully it happens as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""I just need to keep working hard.
""If I keep getting consistent game time for Edinburgh, hopefully I will do enough to show the Scotland coaches what I can do. I am still young but everyone is in a rush so we will see.""
Ritchie, not 20 until August, is one of eight youngsters in Edinburgh's starting side on Friday to have come through the ranks in the past two years.
Another is full-back Blair Kinghorn, also 19, who makes only his fourth senior start after kicking 14 points in last Sunday's 24-23 win over Scarlets.
""He was a schoolboy last year and now he is starting for Edinburgh,"" Solomons noted. ""But that is marvellous - it's what it is all about.
""These guys are the future of the club and it is brilliant they are getting these opportunities.
""Blair has got a good temperament. He's a fairly phlegmatic, chilled guy and has done really well.""",Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons believes teenage flanker Jamie Ritchie is destined to play for Scotland.
6,"The rebel leader Timoleon Jimenez, known as Timochenko, apologised to ""all the victims of the conflict"" and was greeted by cheers and applause.
He said: ""I would like to ask for forgiveness for all the pain that we have caused during this war.""

Who are the Farc?
President Santos: From hawk to dove
Timochenko, the guerrilla leader who talks peace
Inside the village where Farc rebels will lay down their arms
President Juan Manuel Santos said: ""Colombia celebrates, the planet celebrates because there is one less war in the world.
We will achieve any goal, overcome any hurdle and turn our nation into a country we've always dreamed of - a country in peace.""
Timochenko said the Farc, which began as the armed wing of the Communist Party in 1964, is leaving armed conflict behind and moving in to peaceful politics.
""We are being reborn to launch a new era of reconciliation and of building peace,"" he said.
""Let us all be prepared to disarm our hearts.""
The president and Timochenko used a pen made from a bullet to sign the deal.
There was so much symbolism in this historic signing - a pen made from a bullet to sign the peace deal, the singing of Beethoven's Ode to Joy, everyone dressed in white.
President Santos said this historic moment was a message from Colombia to the world: no more war. ""No more war,"" the crowd chanted in return.
This was the first time Timochenko addressed the nation live on TV. He promised the Farc would give up its guns, and more than that, he asked for forgiveness.
It earned him a standing ovation. That would have been unthinkable not long ago.
But after 50 years of war, many Colombians still aren't ready to forgive. As President Santos put it, the hard work of building peace now lies ahead.
The deal comes after four years of talks in Havana, Cuba, between government and rebel negotiators.  It must be approved by the Colombian people in a popular vote on Sunday before it can pass into law.
Polls indicate the majority of Colombians will vote for it, although there has been some opposition, led by ex-president Alvaro Uribe.
Under the deal, the Farc will be relaunched as a political party. Correspondents say that although there is widespread hope that the deal may bring an end to the kidnappings and bloodshed that have blighted Colombia over five decades, it has also led to divisions in Latin America's fourth-biggest economy.
Some people are angry that it allows rebels to enter parliament without serving time in prison.
Correspondents say President Santos has risked his political future on the success of the peace deal.
Dignitaries attending the ceremony included UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, US Secretary of State John Kerry and Cuban President Raul Castro.
Mr Ban told the ceremony: ""You can look to the future with optimism. You are inviting Colombians to live in peace.""
As Mr Kerry arrived in the country, he praised Mr Santos' efforts to secure the deal and pledged $390m (Â£300m) to help implement it.
The US is not yet ready to remove the Farc from its list of terrorist organisations, he said, but is prepared to review that sanction once the peace agreement is up and running.
However, only hours before the signing, the EU announced it would suspend the Farc from its list.
""This decision will allow us to support the post-conflict programme and will be of benefit to all Colombians,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on social media.
Farc rebels must now hand over weapons to the UN within 180 days.
But the smaller ELN rebel group is still active, as are right-wing paramilitary groups.

7,"The contest, which began in 1978, has become one of the most popular classical music awards in the country.
Held every two years, it returns to Edinburgh's Usher Hall this weekend, with three of the country's most talented young musicians competing for the accolade.
Nicola Benedetti is one of its most famous winners. She took the award in 2004, at the aged of 16, performing a rendition of Karol Szymanowski's First Violin Concerto.
Born in West Kilbride, North Ayrshire, in 1987, Benedetti was destined for a success as a classical musician from an early age.
At the age of eight, she became the leader of the National Children's Orchestra of Great Britain. By the time she was 12 she was regularly performing with the Scottish National Orchestra.
Ten years after her BBC triumph she believes the competition's ability to give young musicians a chance to express themselves on a major stage remains a special one.
""So much of it is who you are, and what you are trying to express in that moment.,"" she said.
""It's the ability to cope with a multitude of emotions, to bring that all together in a moment that lives once.""
After winning the competition she became one of the most recognisable faces in classical music.
By the end of that year she had signed a Â£1m recording deal with the classical arm of Decca Records for six albums.
She has remained a firm favourite for classical concert audiences. Her career includes an acclaimed performance at the 2012 Last Night of the Proms.
Last year she was awarded an MBE for services to charity and music.
A common theme across Benedetti's career is her attempts to help convey her passion for classical music to music fans who might not consider the genre as being ""cool"".
She has played live performances for events as diverse as Glasgow's Celtic Connections festival, traditionally a platform for Scottish folk artists.
In 2012 she was given the opportunity to get 40,000 festival campers out of their tents when she opened the main stage at the T in the Park Festival at Balado.
The chance to pass on her love of music is something she remains passionate about. Speaking to a packed classroom of children in India as part of a BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra tour she attempted to explain why performing means so much to her:
""I love it very much... you know your emotions? Well music can make you feel all kinds of emotions. It makes you feel very good.""
She admits that despite having played in the Usher Hall several times since her winning performance for the BBC competition, the venue still rekindles a ""special feeling"" for her.
""I just cannot disassociate the hall from that feeling, which is a pleasure really.""
""I was talking to some of the young musicians, saying that I hope some of my remembered apprehension doesn't rub off on them negatively.""
She laughs, then adds:  ""I'm going to have to act like I'm a little cool.""","Nicola Benedetti is returning as an ambassador for this year's BBC Young Musician of the Year finals, 10 years after winning the award which catapulted her to stardom ."
8,"These investors want the world's biggest publicly traded oil company to support the goal of a 2C global temperature limit.
Exxon Mobil is also being investigated for potential fraud by withholding information on the role of fossil fuels in driving up temperatures.
The company says that the shareholder resolutions are unnecessary, while the investigations by several states are ""politically motivated.""
For around a quarter of a century, a varied collection of climate activists and institutions concerned about rising temperatures have attempted to get Exxon Mobil to move forward on the issue of climate change.
This year, they believe the coalition attempting to force change on the issue, is the strongest ever assembled. Investors with at least $8tn under management have indicated they will support greater recognition of the climate change issue.
At the AGM here in Dallas, the company faces resolutions including one to appoint a board member who has a high degree of climate expertise.
One motion asks the company to support the goal of limiting warming to below 2 degrees in line with the Paris climate agreement. Another asks Exxon to disclose how resilient its investments would be if policy measures to restrict warming to 2 degrees were implemented.
This motion has a number of supporters including the Norwegian government's pension fund, the world's largest.
It's being co-sponsored by the Church Commissioners, who manage the Church of England's investment fund.
Their head of responsible investment says the board of Exxon Mobil should now recognise the new realities.
""It's a moment where Exxon really has to recognise that the world is changing,"" Edward Mason told BBC News.
""Climate change is real, the transition to a low carbon economy is real, and they need to get on board with this.""
The shareholders' hopes of success have been boosted by a number of factors, including a growing number of institutional investors Schroders, AXA and Legal and General which have supported the proposal. They are also backed by the largest pension fund in the US, CalPERS.
The world's leading advisers to proxy voters, ISS and Glass Lewis, have also come out in favour of the resolution on climate risk disclosure. A group of 1,000 academics from leading institutions have written to support the resolutions.
Shareholder pressure has also been successful at other large oil companies, with BP and Shell both accepting resolutions to routinely report on their asset portfolio's resilience to climate change.
The board of Exxon Mobil are resolutely opposed to the motions on increased cognisance of climate change issues.
While the climate resolutions are non-binding on the company, many believe that if they are supported by a majority of shareholders, Exxon Mobil will have to make significant changes.
""I think they will have to change or die because you are going to get nation states demanding that they change,"" said Capuchin priest Fr Michael Crosby who has been attempting to get Exxon Mobil to change on this issue for 19 years.
Exxon can trace its origins back to 1870 when John D Rockefeller created the Standard Oil Company .
Exxon and Mobil merged in 1999 in a deal valued around $80bn. The combined value of the company in 2015 was $353bn, making it the world's most valuable, publicly traded oil company.
The company employs around 75,000 around the world.
The oil spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska in 1989 was the biggest in US history until Deepwater Horizon in 2010.
In 2016, the Rockefeller foundation said it would eliminate its holdings in Exxon, saying the company had misled the public over climate change.
""The countries where they operate are going to say you can't do what you're doing and will tax them out of existence or what ever.""
Exxon says that climate change is a ""very real"" issue for the company but believes the shareholders' resolutions are unnecessary. They say that since 2007 they have included a proxy price for carbon in all their forecasts, which essentially means they have been factoring in a likely cost of more restrictive CO2 policies.
""I think the 'change or die' comments are a little dramatic, Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers told BBC News.
""The issue is an important one, climate change presents very real risks that need to be managed but so do energy requirements of the modern economy. So we see that as a dual challenge to continue to provide that energy that all of us depend on while also managing the risks of climate change.""
As well as dealing with shareholder activism on the issue of climate change, Exxon is also facing a number of legal challenges on the same issue.
Over the last year though, a number of journalistic investigations have raised questions about when Exxon's researchers first knew about climate change and how much information they passed on to shareholders and the general public.
Attorneys General from New York, Massachusetts, California and the US Virgin Islands have launched investigations into Exxon to determine if they acted fraudulently.
The Virgin Islands investigation has particularly irked the company as it seeks to uncover links between Exxon and private organisations that may have been used to spread doubt about climate science, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
""If a company knew that climate posed serious risks but nonetheless sought to convince large numbers of consumers and investors that those risks were overstated, I think that is a serious matter for investigation,"" Carroll Muffett from the Centre for International Environmental Law.
""The reality facing the oil industry is that their situation is looking increasingly like the situation of the tobacco companies - and as much as they like to claim there are no parallels, there is more and more information coming to light that says there are parallels and they are real.""
Exxon Mobil and their supporters have come out fighting on this question, decrying the investigations as an attack on freedom of speech.
""There is a pretty defined strategy to go back and try to paint us as some sort of big tobacco and we categorically reject that and it does not stand up to independent scrutiny,"" said Alan Jeffers, from Exxon.
The Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said that the Virgin Islands investigation was ""ridiculous"", and said it was an ""effort to punish Exxon for daring to hold an opinion on climate change that differs from that of radical environmentalists"".

9,"There have been regular protests by the Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) since October.
A record 18,000 people turned out to support a rally on Monday in Dresden.
But where did Pegida come from and why is the group growing so fast?
Pegida is a German political movement based in Dresden in the west of the country.
It claims to be anti-Islamist and against what it sees as the growing influence of Islam in Europe.
The group also says it is not a racist organisation but that it is concerned by levels of immigration in Germany, which are at a 20-year high.
Pegida's online proposal claims it is ""against radicalism"" and ""preachers of hate"" and calls for stricter enforcement of Germany's current laws on asylum and deportation.
Pegida has been holding regular marches in Dresden for nearly three months.
Demonstrators at the largest pro-Pegida rally to-date on 5 January were heard chanting ""we are the people"" with one man telling the BBC ""we don't want Mosques in Dresden.""
Counter demonstrations have sprung up and the group has been condemned by senior German politicians.
German chancellor Angela Merkel has criticised the protests, calling them xenophobic and racist.
In her New Year address on German television she told the public: ""Don't follow these people.""
She said the people behind Pegida have ""coldness, prejudice and hatred in their hearts"".
In Cologne, the authorities switched the lights out at the city's cathedral as a way of warning Pegida supporters that they were supporting ""extremists"".
""We don't think of it as a protest, but we would like to make the many conservative Christians [who support Pegida] think about what they are doing,"" Dean Norbert Feldhoff, told the BBC.
Only about 250 Pegida supporters showed up in Cologne, compared to thousands of counter-demonstrators.
In Berlin, police said 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked hundreds of Pegida supporters from marching along their planned route.
At the Dresden march the counter-demonstration attracted 3,000 people.

10,"Wales has the lowest numbers of female chartered engineers in Britain - just 5.6% compared to 5.9% in England and 6% in Scotland, Engineering UK says.
Prof Karen Holford, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said talent was being ""wasted"".
A Welsh government review is looking into the lack of women in the industry.
Prof Holford, who is the pro vice chancellor of Cardiff University's college of physical sciences, told BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales: ""A lot of the big companies have their research and development bases elsewhere, and I think that's a big problem.
""One of the most fascinating things about engineering and science is the research and development you can do, so I would welcome more high tech research and development jobs for Wales.""
Wales' lack of female engineers compares badly to both the rest of Britain and the rest of Europe. In Sweden, 25% of chartered engineers are female.
It is a problem the Welsh government is grappling with.
Julie Williams, the chief scientific advisor, has commissioned an independent report in to women in STEM - science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A Welsh government spokesman said: ""This review will examine why girls and women are currently underrepresented in these areas, explore what can be done to encourage and support them to pursue STEM opportunities as well as looking at how different organisations in Wales can help to address the problem.""
The report is co-chaired by Prof Holford and its recommendations will be published early next year.
She believes it matters because Wales has a shortage of chartered engineers generally.
Prof Holford added: ""We're wasting talent if we don't crack this.
""Engineering is one of the industries that will create jobs and growth for the nation. So it's critical that we get this right, and that we get the best engineers, the most talented engineers working and staying in Wales.""
Eye on Wales is on Sunday, 29 November at 12:30 GMT on BBC Radio Wales.","More high-tech engineering companies should be based in Wales to attract and retain engineers, particularly female ones, a leading academic says."
11,"The Bradford West MP has been heavily criticised over the Facebook posts, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States.
In a Commons statement she offered a ""profound apology"" for the posts, which were made before she became an MP.
Earlier party leader Jeremy Corbyn warned her about the ""offensive and unacceptable"" posts and David Cameron called for her suspension.
Labour said: ""Jeremy Corbyn and Naz Shah have mutually agreed that she is administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the general secretary.
""Pending investigation, she is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed.""
Apologising in the Commons, Ms Shah, who had already quit as an unpaid aide to shadow chancellor John McDonnell, said: ""Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relationships between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none.""
The announcement of her suspension came after pressure mounted on the MP, with Mr Cameron saying during Prime Minister's Questions it was ""quite extraordinary"" that Labour had not withdrawn the whip from her over what he suggested were ""racist"" comments.
Saying sorry three times didn't prevent Naz Shah's suspension.
Number 10 are taking credit - but one shadow cabinet member, Lisa Nandy, had already called for her suspension and I'm told other Labour figures had approached party officials privately to call for the same thing.
Ten days ago Labour's general secretary had reassured MPs those accused of anti-Semitism would be expelled or suspended.
Insiders say that once the Labour leader had decided to hand the matter to party officials, suspension - and an investigation - became inevitable.
Most Labour MPs recognise few members hold anti-Semitic views but that some high-profile cases have been toxic, and have been pressing their leadership to be more proactive in uncovering and rooting out unacceptable views.
And some on the party's right are keen to force a leader who has opposed ""witch hunts"" of party members to use disciplinary procedures to erect, however reluctantly, some walls to Labour's broad church - and to make clear that the views of some recent members and supporters aren't welcome.
Minutes before PMQs, Mr Corbyn issued a statement, saying: ""These are historic social media posts made before she was a member of parliament. Naz has issued a fulsome apology.
""She does not hold these views and accepts she was completely wrong to have made these posts. The Labour Party is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and all forms of racism.""
Labour MP Lisa Nandy had called for Ms Shah's suspension, while another Labour MP, Kate Hoey, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One she should resign ""right away"" from the Commons Home Affairs Committee, which is carrying out an inquiry into anti-Semitism.

Naz Shah burst onto the political scene during the 2015 general election, where she ousted Respect MP George Galloway.
Her selection as a candidate proved controversial with divisions emerging in the local party. The candidate who was chosen first stood down four days later, before Ms Shah was imposed by the ruling National Executive Committee.
A bitter campaign followed, with Mr Galloway sparking anger by questioning Ms Shah's account of her forced marriage.
After her victory, she was celebrated locally and nationally for her unique background and life experiences.
Growing up in poverty in Bradford, Ms Shah and her family were abandoned by her father who eloped with a neighbour's teenage daughter. She has spoken openly about her experience of surviving a forced marriage and domestic violence.
In a Facebook post in 2014, Ms Shah shared a graphic showing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"", with the comment ""problem solved"".
The post suggested the US has ""plenty of land"" to accommodate Israel as a 51st state, allowing Palestinians to ""get their life and their land back"".
It added Israeli people would be welcome and safe in the US, while the ""transportation cost"" would be less than three years' worth of Washington's support for Israeli defence spending.
Ms Shah added a note suggesting the plan might ""save them some pocket money"".
The post was brought to light by the Guido Fawkes website, which also highlighted a post in which she appeared to liken Israeli policies to those of Hitler.
In a statement, the MP said: ""I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict.
""But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise.""
She set out a more detailed apology in an article for Jewish News.
""The language I used was wrong,"" she wrote.
""It is hurtful. What's important is the impact these posts have had on other people. I understand that referring to Israel and Hitler as I did is deeply offensive to Jewish people for which I apologise.""
The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were ""simply appalling"", calling for an urgent meeting ""for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community"".",Labour has suspended MP Naz Shah over comments she made about Israel.

Reality Check verdict: A second referendum on the UK's membership of the EU seems both unlikely to happen and unlikely to give a different result to the first one. A referendum on the deal reached for leaving the EU is possible but not required by current legislation.
It is not the first time it has been mentioned.
Actually, it was discussed much earlier in the campaign with Michael Howard suggesting in February that a vote to leave could ""shake EU leaders out of their complacency"" and lead them to offer the UK a better deal to persuade the country to stay.
There has been no sign of that happening so far.
But second referendums have been in the news - Nicola Sturgeon wants a second referendum on Scottish independence, and it has been less than two years since the last one.
It would not be the first time there has been a second referendum when the population of a member state has voted against the EU.
In Denmark, a second referendum was held after voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty.
A deal was done giving the country an optout of the euro and home and justice affairs, and the second referendum passed.
In Ireland, a second referendum was held after the original referendum had rejected the Nice Treaty.
Again, concessions were made and the second vote passed.
Ireland also had two votes on the Lisbon Treaty.
In each case, the unanimous approval of EU members had been needed for treaty changes, so the whole process would have stalled if the referendums had not passed.
That is not the case with the UK's decision.
The referendum in the UK was, strictly speaking, only an advisory one.
Tottenham MP David Lammy has said that people could ""stop this madness through a vote in Parliament"", and there has been a big petition calling for another referendum.
But Dr Simon Usherwood, from the think tank UK in a Changing Europe, says that if there was a second referendum, it would annoy the electorate and make people more likely to vote to leave.
""The public would also very likely take a second vote... as a mark of bad faith, and would respond accordingly,"" he says.
""Rather than avoiding Brexit, it would simply harden the decision.""
In a post-referendum poll by ComRes, 92% of leave voters said they were happy with the outcome, while 4% of remain voters were happy (and, overall, 7% were indifferent).
MPs have rushed to say the democratic process must be respected and the UK must leave the EU, among them Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
But Mr Hunt wrote in Tuesday morning's Daily Telegraph newspaper that there would need to be a vote on the terms on which the UK leaves.
""We need to negotiate a deal and put it to the British people, either in a referendum or through the Conservative manifesto at a fresh general election,"" he wrote.
Mr Hunt is talking about having this vote before the UK triggers Article 50, which begins the process of the UK leaving the EU.
That would mean waiting for a new prime minister to take over, negotiating a deal on the UK's trade relationship with the EU and, then, holding either a referendum or a snap general election, or indeed waiting for the scheduled one in May 2020, before triggering Article 50.
And bear in mind that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said there cannot be any discussions of the terms of the UK's deal before Article 50 has been triggered.
Whether there has to be a referendum on the deal with the EU will be a matter for Parliament and the next prime minister, but the current legislation does not require there to be one.
The European Union Act 2011 ""ensures that if in the future there is a proposed treaty change or decision in the existing treaties that moves a power or an area of policy from the UK to the EU, the government will require the British people's consent in a referendum before it can be agreed"", but the negotiations are unlikely to move power in that direction.

13,"No wonder he's struggling in the polls with women voters - it would be remarkable if he wasn't.
Before we get to the latest brouhaha over abortions, let's take the last point first.
Donald Trump says he loves women. He says he employs lots of senior women in his company. His daughter, Ivanka, is clearly a powerhouse. He also claims that he will be the best candidate for women.
But how, in 2016, does that square with having such an old-fashioned view of parenting duties?
One of the biggest things holding professional women back from participating full-time in the workforce is not having husbands who are prepared to share 50% of all child-rearing chores.
It is really hard for a woman to put in the time needed to succeed at work if her husband won't pitch in fully at home. By saying, almost boasting, that nappy changing isn't for him, Mr Trump is not being a good role model for other men.
He is sending a subliminal message that women should do mother's work while he gets on with the business. Not helpful - or, in Trumpish - sad!

Trump, Clinton and the ""none-of-the-above"" era of politics
Who's funding Trump's campaign?
Five ways Republican nomination could end
It is part of an old-fashioned machismo that the Trump campaign has cultivated. A lot of it is about sex and sexual conquests. Boasting about the size of your penis on a TV debate was only one incident.
Years ago Mr Trump called Tucker Carlson, a TV presenter who'd insulted the famous ""Trump coif"", and left him a message saying Carlson had better hair but Trump had more sex with women (and he said it in a far more indelicate way).
In 1997, Mr Trump triumphantly told a radio host he could have ""nailed"" Princess Diana.
And - in what must count as two of the more bizarre statistics of this campaign - according to a recent study by dating site Match (formerly match.com) single Donald Trump supporters are 1,104% more likely to expect sex on a first date than Hillary Clinton supporters.
They are also 99% more likely to film themselves having sex. I think this means they are more likely to be men.
Promoting your sexual prowess works well with men who feel threatened by the growing influence of women in the workforce, and by the realisation that women are now better educated than men.
In the New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks, refers to it is as the enabling of a ""bad-boy protest movement"". But this regressive gender stereotyping is less appealing to women.
According to a March NBC/WSJ poll 47% of female Republican primary voters cannot see themselves voting for Trump while only 32% say the same about Ted Cruz.
And Mr Trump consistently has a 20-odd point gap in support between men and women. A gap he has acknowledged he needs to do something about.
Which brings us to the unique U-turn Mr Trump performed on Wednesday after saying in a televised town hall event that women who have abortions should be punished. He quickly put out a statement reversing that position.
He did so after howls of protests from both pro-life and pro-choice groups.
It isn't easy to bring these two deeply divided sides together in common cause, but, for a few moments, Mr Trump succeeded. Punishing the woman has never been the position of even the most ardent anti-abortionists here.
Sticking to that original town hall statement would have made it very difficult for Mr Trump to close his gap with women voters.
Since single, suburban women will probably decide the outcome of this election, that is something Mr Trump has to do to become president.","Donald Trump said women who have abortions should be punished, he made crude insinuations about a TV anchor's menstrual cycle and he doesn't change nappies or do bedtimes."
14,"They'll be sorting out how Team Trump will take over power in January.
It could be an awkward meeting, because the two men have often criticised each other in the past.
Donald Trump won the US election to become the new president, beating his opponent Hillary Clinton.
But lots of people were unhappy with the result, and there were protests overnight in some American cities.","The new president-elect of the US, Donald Trump, will visit President Obama at the White House today."
15,"Most of the 158 seats have been filled with just 10 left to be allocated.
So far, Fine Gael remains the largest party with 47 seats - a four-seat lead over its main rival, Fianna Fáil.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has said a new government should not be formed before reforms of the Dail (parliament) take place.
""We believe that the new Dáil should not represent more business as usual - that it should involve a decisive move towards a reformed politics,"" he said.
Former prime minister (taioseach) Bertie Ahern said he believed talks to form a new coalition government would not be concluded before Easter.
The current taoiseach, Enda Kenny, admitted over the weekend that the Fine Gael/Labour coalition government he led for the past five years had failed to secure a return to office.
He will continue to lead the Republic of Ireland in a caretaker capacity until a new coalition is agreed.
It is now likely that Mr Kenny will be one of three party leaders who could be proposed as a potential Taoiseach when the parliament (Dàil) reconvenes on 10 March.
The other candidates are Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams.
Sinn Féin is currently in third place with 22 seats while independents and smaller parties have also done well with 30 seats between them so far.
However, the junior coalition partner, Labour, has suffered badly with only six seats so far, after winning 37 in 2011.
As counting entered its third day on Monday, Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan told the state broadcaster RTÉ that Irish politics is in a state of flux.
Mr Flanagan acknowledged that Fine Gael had made mistakes during its campaign but he expressed continuing confidence in his leader Mr Kenny.
Electoral staff are re-examining the ballot papers in Wexford, Longford-Westmeath and three Dublin constituencies.
Notable candidates to lose their seats over the weekend include Fine Gael deputy leader and children's minister, James Reilly, Fine Gael junior minister Jimmy Deenihan and Labour Party's Alex White, the communications minister.
Alan Kelly, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, narrowly retained his seat.
Despite polling well in the election, Sinn Féin lost a seat in Donegal when independent candidate Thomas Pringle was selected ahead of Pádraig Mac Lochlainn.
Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil indicated that they would not go into coalition with each other.
Mr Kenny - who has been re-elected in Mayo - said it was clear the existing government would not regain power.
He refused to discuss possible options for the next government.
However, he added: ""As taoiseach I have a duty and responsibility to see how best we might be able to put together a government.""
On Saturday, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said he was ""very pleased"" but that it would take time before the shape of the new government becomes clear.
Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said the election represented a ""fundamental realignment of Irish politics"".
""Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael no longer command a majority of support,"" he said.
""These parties cannot and will not deliver the changes required in health and housing.""
Labour Party deputy leader Alan Kelly, who narrowly retained his seat in Tipperary, said Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael should ""cop themselves on now"" and form a government.
""All of this pretending that there are massive issues between them is rubbish.
""They need to come together, work together and put a government in place for the good of the people.""
More than three million people were entitled to vote in Friday's poll, which will return 157 members of parliament, known as TDs. The speaker is automatically returned.
The campaign was fought mainly over economic issues, with the government parties asking voters for their support to keep the recovery going at a time when international storm clouds were gathering.
But the opposition parties countered that not everyone, especially outside middle-class Dublin, had been benefiting from the up-turn.
The Republic of Ireland has had the fastest growing economy in the eurozone for the last two years.
TDs are being elected according to the single transferable vote system, in which candidates have to reach a quota, before their surplus votes are distributed to others.","Recounts are continuing in three constituencies in the Irish election, but there is still no firm indication on who will form the new government."

17,"Mr Carmichael confirmed the memo was written in the Scotland Office but denied it was embarrassing for him.
He said: ""This is the middle of an election campaign, these things happen.""
Ms Sturgeon has said the claims in the memo are ""100% untrue"".
She was alleged to have told the French ambassador that she would prefer to see the Conservatives remain in power after the 7 May general election.
Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has ordered an inquiry into how the note got into the public domain.
Mr Carmichael told Channel 4 News: ""I understand that the memo in question did actually come from the Scotland Office, but these things are circulated within government.""
Meanwhile, chancellor George Osborne has said the UK would have higher debt and taxes and weaker defences if the SNP ""propped up a weak Ed Miliband government"".
Mr Osborne said it was clear there would be ""an unholy alliance"" between Labour and the SNP in the election.
He argued that SNP leaders were ""much stronger"" than Mr Miliband.
The SNP said the claims were ""simply untrue"" while Labour said the SNP and the Tories were ""playing political games"" with the country's future.
Labour has ruled out any formal coalition with the SNP in the event that the general election results in a hung parliament. But Mr Miliband has stopped short of ruling out a more informal alliance.
On Sunday, Ms Sturgeon renewed her appeal to the Labour leader to work with the SNP in order to ""lock David Cameron out of Downing Street"" after the 7 May vote.
Speaking to Sky News, Mr Osborne said: ""The fact that a Labour party which was a party that campaigned for the United Kingdom in the referendum is contemplating an arrangement with the SNP who want to break up the country is deeply disturbing.
""People know that Ed Miliband is weak, that the Scottish Nationalist leaders are much stronger than he is, and we know who would be running that government.
""That would be bad for the entire United Kingdom, bad for the integrity of the union, but also bad for our economy because it would mean higher debts and higher taxes.""
Asked if Labour could form an anti-austerity alliance with the SNP, Labour's Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie told Sky News: ""I'm not sure quite what the SNP are saying - they say one thing in public and another thing, it appears, in minutes.
""I don't know quite what was going on there but I think a lot of people are not surprised at the revelations that perhaps Nicola Sturgeon actually does secretly want a Conservative government.
""Why do they want that? Well, they'd love to get into a second referendum and look at jeopardising the Union in this way.
""The SNP and the Conservatives, I think, are playing political games with our country's future.
""We have ruled out a coalition with the SNP. We don't believe in doing that with them, because they believe in totally different things, in breaking up the United Kingdom. We don't believe in that.""
The SNP's general election campaign director Angus Robertson said Mr Osborne's claims were ""simply untrue"".
He added: ""The SNP is putting forward sensible plans for modest spending increases instead of cuts, which would support investment and public services while still reducing the deficit.
""In contrast, all that is on offer from the Tories is tens of billions of pounds worth of further austerity that would do further damage to communities across Scotland.""
On Sunday, Ms Sturgeon called on Mr Miliband to work with her party after the general election.
Writing in the Observer newspaper she said: ""I repeat my challenge to Ed Miliband - if together our parties have the parliamentary numbers required after 7 May, and regardless of which is the biggest party, will he and Labour join with us in locking David Cameron out of Downing Street?""
Ms Sturgeon's comments came after an inquiry was set up over the leak of a memo claiming she would prefer the Tories to win the election.
Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood ordered the investigation into how the document, published in the Daily Telegraph, got into the public domain.
Ms Sturgeon said the account of a conversation she had with the French ambassador was ""100% untrue"".
French officials said she had not expressed a preference for prime minister.
Ms Sturgeon has accused Whitehall of ""dirty tricks"" over the Daily Telegraph story.
Meanwhile on the election campaign trail, SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie was in Dundee, urging voters to back his party in order to secure ""a fairer future"" for families across the UK.
He said: ""This election offers Scotland - and the rest of the UK - the chance for change, breaking out of the mould of two and three party politics.
""Last week's seven party leaders' debate showed there is an appetite across the UK for progressive voices to be heard.""
In a ""State of the Race"" memo to Scottish Labour activists, deputy leader Kezia Dugdale said the past week had ""demonstrated clearly"" the choice on offer at the election.
She also highlighted the reach of Scottish Labour's campaign, adding that the party had already been in touch with every one of the 190,000 voters that leader Jim Murphy committed to contacting in December.
She added: ""We've still got over four weeks left, and we need to build on the success we've had so far.""
During a visit to Edinburgh, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael claimed working Scots would pay Â£400 a year more under the SNP's income tax plan than they would under his party, the Liberal Democrats.
He said: ""The SNP talk a good game about helping the less advantaged, but they don't have a redistributive policy to their name.
""Here's a chance for Nicola Sturgeon to match the Liberal Democrat promise of an additional Â£400 tax cut for the less well off. She doesn't want to.""","Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has said the leaking of a memo which claimed Nicola Sturgeon would prefer David Cameron to be prime minister was ""just one of those things""."
18,"He suggested that immigration, rather than trade, would be the biggest issue for the City of London after the UK leaves the European Union.
Banks are increasingly becoming technology companies and so they need the best engineers, Mr Staley said.
Keeping that talent should be the government's top priority, he added.
His comments signal a shift among City groups after suggestions last year that the biggest risk from Brexit was the loss of EU trading rights.
Mr Staley told the BBC: ""Making sure we have access to the best and brightest of talent around the world coming to London... is perhaps the most important thing for the financial industry, perhaps even more important than passporting.""
So-called passporting rights allow banks to serve clients across the EU without the need for licences in individual countries.
They are considered by some to be vital to London's position as a financial hub.
However, Mr Staley, who was speaking at a Brexit event in London, said the strength of the City came from the ""intellectual capital"" of its workers.
For that reason, Google's decision to expand its presence in London was potentially ""the most important economic announcement post-Brexit"", the Barclays boss said.
He added that banks would benefit from the calibre of workers that Google attracts after it made London its second most important development hub outside of San Francisco.
It's been commonly assumed that banks are most concerned about their ability to sell their services into the EU from London - so-called ""passporting"" - but today's comments show priorities are changing as the chances of retaining those rights look all but dead.
Both Mr Staley and the chairman of HSBC, Douglas Flint, said that contingency plans to deal with the passporting issue were close to being triggered.
Both men seemed sceptical that enough clarity on the future shape of the UK's relationship would emerge in time for them to put on hold plans to move jobs and functions into the EU.
Barclays is planning to move at least 150 jobs to Dublin, which will become a fully fledged European subsidiary. HSBC has already announced plans to move 1,000 jobs to Paris.

Mr Staley said banks would start shifting some operations to the EU ""reasonably"" soon to avoid disruption after Brexit.
The UK has opened formal Brexit talks with the EU, but it is unclear what levels of access businesses will have to EU markets after its departure.
Mr Staley was speaking after Brexit Secretary David Davis told the conference in London that the UK's place in the world was being reshaped.
""Securing an agreement with the EU within the two-year period about our withdrawal and the shape of our future relationship will be challenging,"" Mr Davis said.
A report commissioned by TheCityUK late last year found that up to 75,000 jobs could be lost in financial services if the UK left the EU single market.
The British Bankers Association also warned banks were getting ready to relocate out of the UK to continue serving customers in Europe.
Both groups have said recently that access to EU markets and talent are key priorities in the Brexit talks.","Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has said access to talented workers after Brexit is ""tremendously important"" for the UK's financial sector."
19,"At least 15 of the 38 people shot dead during the attack on a beach in the popular resort of Sousse were British.
None of the victims have been formally named by the Foreign Office.
Meanwhile, the family of a Trehafod man shot while protecting his fiancee say he is now ""stable"" and ""comfortable"" in hospital, after flying home.
Many British tourists returned on Saturday on special flights while the first of two scheduled flights to Cardiff arrived on Sunday morning.
Mr Jones said: ""It has been shocking to hear the details of the horrific attack in Tunisia. My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this senseless act of violence.
""I am being kept informed about the situation in Tunisia as we learn more about the identities of those killed.
""We know that at least 15 of those killed have been British, and while there have not yet been any confirmed victims from Wales, we must prepare ourselves for that possibility.
""The Welsh government is ready to offer any assistance it can as we deal with the aftermath of this tragedy.""
Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui, 23, who has reported links with Islamic State (IS), opened fire on tourists at noon on Friday.
Matthew James, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, used his body as a human shield while trying to protect his fiancee Saera Wilson, 26, when the gunman began firing.
He has since flown home, his family confirmed on Sunday.
In a statement released by police, his family said: ""Matthew is currently in a stable and comfortable condition - and he and his fiancee Saera are doing well, and are happy to be back in the UK.
""They wish to thank all of the medical teams in both Tunisia and the UK for all of their professional assistance, care and support.""
More details have emerged of the attack, which saw Rezgui shoot at people on the beach near the Imperial Marhaba and Bellevue hotels.
He entered at least one of the hotel lobbies, where grenades were also detonated.
He then walked through the streets of Sousse where he was reportedly chased by local Tunisians, firing shots at them.
It has also been reported that local builders threw rubble down at him from rooftops as he passed by in the street. The attack eventually ended when he was shot dead by police.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered close to the scene a day after the attack for a rally against terrorism, with some holding candles and others carrying flags of the UK and Tunisia.
One of the survivors who was flown into Manchester on Saturday, has arrived back in Wales and posted on social media her family was ""totally traumatised and in total shock and disbelief"".
Leiha Shaw, 28, from Swansea, said: ""I cannot explain to you how terrifying and frightening the past 24 hours have been for myself and my family.
""I have never in all my life been so scared and I honestly thought that we were going to lose our lives to an out of control gunman that had totally devastated so many peoples lives throughout the country.
""Although I didn't see anyone being shot I will forever be haunted by the noise of bullets and explosions that seared through the beach. My thoughts and prayers are with the families that have had loved ones murdered in cold blood.""
Several other tourists from Wales have also been caught up in the attacks.
Elsewhere, Wrexham FC footballer Wes York, 22, left Sousse just 48 hours before the killings.
The striker told the Daily Post he would have been at the targeted beach, had he not cut his holiday short to prepare for pre-season training.
""I have been watching what has happened on TV and it just sends chills down your spine to think I was only just there,"" he said.","There is a ""possibility"" some of those killed in the Tunisia terrorist attack came from Wales, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned."

He said there had to be a ""fair and balanced"" settlement with English MPs deciding on laws applying to England.
But defeated SNP leader Alex Salmond warned against any delay in shifting powers to Scotland as he announced his decision to step down.
""For me as leader, my time is nearly done,"" he said. ""For Scotland, the campaign continues and the dream shall never die.""
Scotland's First Minister explained his decision to quit just hours after Scotland voted decisively to stay in the United Kingdom by 2,001,926 votes to 1,617,989 - about 55% to 45%.
The vote is the culmination of a two-year campaign. Talks will now begin on devolving more powers to Scotland.
BBC political editor Nick Robinson
The people have spoken. Scotland has rejected independence. The result has been accepted by both sides. So that you might think is that. Not a bit of it.
The fact that over 1.5m British citizens voted not to remain part of the UK, the fact that a majority in Scotland's biggest city - Glasgow - backed independence, the fact that the Westminster establishment briefly thought this vote was lost, is the reason for that.
The leaders of the three UK parties are now promising significant constitutional change and not just for Scotland but for England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.
They have agreed on a timetable for giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament but are a long, long way from agreeing proposals.
Read more from Nick Robinson.
Mr Salmond said he was ""immensely proud"" of his Yes campaign and serving as Scotland's First Minister had been ""the privilege of my life"", but he conceded that the SNP would benefit from new leadership to take the process on.
The party had ""the opportunity to hold Westminster's feet to the fire on the 'vow' that they have made to devolve further meaningful power to Scotland,"" he said. ""This places Scotland in a very strong position.""
But while he would continue to serve as MSP for Aberdeenshire East, he had decided to stand down after the party's annual conference in November.
""We lost the referendum vote but can still carry the political initiative,"" he said. ""More importantly Scotland can still emerge as the real winner.""
In a statement outside Downing Street Mr Cameron defended the decision to hold the referendum, saying it was right that the SNP's majority in Holyrood was respected.
He said Lord Smith of Kelvin had agreed to oversee the process of devolving more powers over tax, spending and welfare to Scotland, with draft legislation by the end of January.
Mr Cameron added that the rights of other people in the UK needed to be ""respected and enhanced"". He said he had long believed that a crucial missing part was England. He said ""the millions of voices of England must be heard"".
The Leader of the Commons William Hague has been asked to draw up plans for what would be a fundamental change at Westminster - that only English MPs could vote on English matters.
BBC deputy political editor James Landale
The Downing Street constitutional declaration - as it will become known - marks the start of what potentially could be massive constitutional change.
In particular, the prime minister has promised to give English MPs a greater say over legislation that affects England. He made clear this would cover the same issues over which Scotland will have greater control - tax, spending and welfare. And the changes will be agreed at the same pace with draft legislation by January.
But David Cameron did not spell out the detail, leaving a policy vacuum that will now be filled by Conservative MPs and an army of constitutional experts and think tanks. Everything from a full English parliament to complicated plans for English grand committees will be discussed.
The risk for the PM is that he loses control of this debate.
Read more from James Landale
Mr Hague insisted there was a ""very clear commitment"" to the Scottish reforms pledged by the three main UK parties, but he argued that the English question had to be resolved at the same pace.
""I think it would be inconceivable to go ahead with a further important stage and measure of devolution to parts of the United Kingdom, without addressing this issue,"" he told the BBC.
""Of course it's been an anomaly for quite a long time now that Scottish MPs can vote on everything happening in England, but we the English MPs can no longer do so in Scotland, and indeed nor can the Scottish.
""But it will become absolutely acute - it will become absolutely indefensible with further devolution - and I think people need to know at the time of the general election next May where we all stand on that, whether we've tried to reach an agreement, and if not, it's something they can decide on in the general election.""
'History made'
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the proposal to restrict voting rights for Scottish MPs could undermine a future Labour government - theoretically there could be a Labour PM who lacks a majority of English MPs so is unable to get health or education issues through parliament.
But Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at his party's conference in Manchester, said he would not allow the moment ""to be used for narrow party political advantage"".
Instead he announced plans for a full constitutional convention ""rooted in our nations and regions... to ensure decisions are taken closer to the families and businesses"".
""These issues can no longer be fixed solely by politicians or prime ministers trying to shore up their position in their own party,"" he said. ""The people need to be given a voice too.""
He did not comment on proposals for English-only votes in Parliament, instead calling for more powers to be devolved to regions within England.
'Rash promises'
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was time for the ""clammy grip"" of Westminster and Whitehall to be released ""so that communities, families, cities, towns and villages across the UK feel that they have more say over their destiny than is currently the case"".
Mayor of London Boris Johnson said the result was ""a great day for Britain"" and pressed the case for English devolution. ""What is sauce for the goose has got to be sauce for the gander,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who was sacked by Mr Cameron as environment secretary in July, demanded an immediate recall of Parliament to debate a new constitutional settlement.
He said it had been ""completely unacceptable that right at the end of the campaign we have an ex-Labour leader (Gordon Brown) galloping off up to Scotland making some very rash promises of extensive new powers to the Scottish people - apparently with the endorsement of all three UK party leaders.""
England's voice
Conservative Bernard Jenkin said he supported English votes for English laws, but claimed Mr Cameron's ""No"" campaign had been ""patronising, over bearing,"" and had given very little clarity about the implications of independence - ""just rather a lot of scare stories"".
Ex-Labour minister Frank Field urged the Labour leadership to come up with its own answer to the ""English question"" as soon as possible, warning that the party could not afford to drag its heels or be seen as ""anti-English"".
UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was now time for a ""constitutional convention to find out how a fair UK would work"".
""I think England needs a voice,"" he said. ""We've heard a lot from Scotland. The tail can't continue wagging the dog any longer. We must have English MPs voting on English only matters.""
Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative MPs' 1922 Committee, said he could envisage parliament having English-only days - when English MPs vote on English matters.
Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, he said a separate English parliament could be costly and bureaucratic, but one parliament could sit on different days of the week for different matters.","David Cameron has said it is time for the UK ""to move forward"" after Scotland voted against independence."
21,"He made the solo descent in a submarine called Deepsea Challenger, taking over two hours to reach the bottom.
He spent more than four hours exploring the ocean floor, before a speedy ascent back to the surface.
His craft was kitted out with cameras so he could film the deep in 3D.
""It was absolutely the most remote, isolated place on the planet,"" Mr Cameron told BBC News.
""I really feel like in one day I've been to another planet and come back.""
This is only the second manned expedition to the ocean's deepest depths - the first took place in 1960 when US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard spent about 20 minutes on the ocean floor in a bathyscaphe called the Trieste.
Lt Walsh, who is now in his 80s, joined Mr Cameron and his team of engineers out at sea for the dive.
""It did bring back a lot of memories, just being out there and remembering what we did there,"" he told BBC News. ""It was really grand.""
Mr Cameron has spent the past few years working in secret with his team of engineers to design and build the craft, which weighs 11 tonnes and is more than 7m (23ft) long.
He describes it as a ""vertical torpedo"" that slices through the water allowing him a speedy descent.
The extraordinary attention to detail prevented him from suffering from too much nervousness.
""I can't say that I wasn't apprehensive in the last few days and even the weeks leading up to this, but there's another part of my mind that really understands the engineering and knows why we did everything the way we did,"" he said.
""Any apprehension I had I left at the hatch. When I went into the sub, I was all pilot at that point.""

The tiny compartment that the film-maker sits in is made from thick steel, which is able to resist the 1,000 atmospheres of pressure he experienced at full ocean depth.
The rest of the vertical column is made from a material called syntactic foam - a solid made mostly of hollow ""microballoons"" - giving it enough buoyancy to float back up.
The sub has so many lights and cameras that it is like an underwater TV studio - with Mr Cameron able to direct and film the action from within. He intends to release a documentary.
It also has robotic arms, allowing him to collect samples of rocks and soils, and a team of researchers are working alongside the director to identify any new species. He says that science is key to his mission.
But the first task was to get to the inky depths - which despite untold hours of training, still surprised Mr Cameron.
""My reference frame was going to the Titanic 10 or 12 years ago, and thinking that was the deepest place I could ever imagine,"" he recalled.
""On this dive I blazed past Titanic depth at 12,000 ft and was only a third of the way down, and the numbers keep going up and up and up on the depth gauge.
""You just kind of look at them with a sense of disbelief, and you wonder if the bottom is ever going to be there.""
At the bottom, Mr Cameron encountered incredibly fine silt, which he had to be careful not to disturb. He said he spotted a few small, as-yet unidentified life forms but found the depths to be a ""sterile, almost desert-like place"".
While manned exploration had until now seen a 52-year hiatus, scientists have used two robotic unmanned vehicles to explore the Mariana Trench: Japan's Kaiko made a dive there in 1995 and the US-based Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's vessel Nereus explored the deep in 2008.
Other teams, such as Scotland's Oceanlab, have also been dropping simple landers loaded with bait and cameras into the deepest ocean.
While places like the Mariana Trench were once thought to be of little interest, there has been a recent resurgence of scientific interest in the deep.
Scientists are finding life that can resist the colossal pressures, from deep-sea fish to shrimp-like scavengers called amphipods, some of which can reach 30cm (1ft) long.
They are also trying to understand the role that deep seas trenches play in earthquakes - these cracks in the sea floor are formed at the boundary of two tectonic plates and some believe the push and pull taking place deep underwater could be the cause of major earthquakes, such as the 2011 quake that resulted in such devastation in Japan.
But some scientists question whether manned exploration provides the best platform for scientific research.
Dr Alan Jamieson, from Oceanlab, said: ""I think what James Cameron has done is a really good achievement in terms of human endeavour and technology.
""But my feeling is that manned submersibles like this are limited in scientific capabilities when compared to other systems, mostly due to the fact there is someone in it. Remote or autonomous systems can collect a far greater volume of useful scientific data for far less money.""
Mr Cameron says he does not want this dive to the deep to be a one-off, and wants to use it as a platform for ocean exploration.
His craft may also soon be joined by other manned submersibles vying to reach the ocean's deepest depths.
One of these crafts, the DeepFlight Challenger, belongs to former real estate investor Chris Welsh, and is backed by Virgin's Richard Branson. It is about to begin its water trials.
Its design is based on a plane, and Mr Welsh says he will be ""flying"" down to the deepest ocean.
Google's Eric Schmidt has helped to finance another sub being built by a US marine technology company called Doer Marine. They want this sub to carry two to three people, and are placing a heavy emphasis on science.
And Triton submarines, a Florida-based submersible company, intends to build a sub with a giant glass sphere at its centrepiece to take tourists down to the deepest ocean for $250,000 a ticket.","Hollywood director James Cameron has returned to the surface after plunging nearly 11km (seven miles) down to the deepest place in the ocean, the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific."
22,"Standard Life Opening Event: Bloom is the third in a series of digital commissions celebrating the beginning of the 2017 festival season.
It will see colour, texture and sounds mapped across St Andrew Square over two nights.
The free to the public installation has been created by Leo Warner.
Mr Warner said: ""We decided to place audiences inside the event, encompassing them within nearly half a linear kilometre of projection-mapped architecture and bespoke lighting fixtures, and use music, sound and light to tell a story celebrating the 70-year history of the International Festival and the associated Edinburgh festivals, and the immeasurable impact that it has had on the cultural world.""
The piece charts the transformation of Edinburgh from the post-war years to today's festival city.
It draws upon the city's architecture, cultural heritage and technological innovation.
A newly commissioned musical score from award winning composer Nick Powell will also feature.
The work follows on from The Harmonium Project in 2015 and 2016's Deep Time.
Sir John Falconer, former Lord Provost of Edinburgh and the International Festival's first chairman, spoke of his ambition 70 years ago that the inaugural Edinburgh International Festival should ""provide a platform for the flowering of the human spirit"".
Edinburgh's Lord Provost Frank Ross, said: ""In 1947, my predecessor Lord Provost Falconer championed the inception of the International Festival.
""Today, I am as determined as ever to see the event bring people together from all over Scotland and the world.
""The Standard Life Opening Event: Bloom will provide a beautiful and fitting celebration of our festivals and our city, and of course, the continued flowering of the human spirit.
""We are delighted to have supported our city's festivals for 70 years.""
The opening event will take place on two nights for the first time, on Friday 4 August and 5 Saturday.
It runs from 22:00 to midnight on a 20 minute loop, with tickets available from 10:00 on Monday 3 July.
Ticket holders can access the event arena from 21:00. Non-ticket holders can also attend and will be admitted from 22:30 on a first come first served basis.
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: ""I never tire of championing Scotland's outlook as a welcoming and progressive nation and this is particularly demonstrated in the arts.
""In 1947, the Edinburgh International Festival boldly invited artists from across Europe to perform in the capital. 70 years on, we're revered as a festival nation that welcomes performers and audiences from every corner of the globe.""",A civic square in Edinburgh will be transformed using projected animations to mark the start of the 70th Edinburgh International Festival.
23,"The warning comes from uSwitch, the price comparison and switching service.
It says the biggest increases will be for Npower customers, who could see their bills rise £399.
It adds that 50 fixed energy plans are coming to an end this summer, more than ever before.
There are 14 popular fixed-tariff deals from eight suppliers ending this month alone. The average price increase for customers whose deals end in July is £274 per year.
The biggest hikes are for those on fixed price tariffs with Npower, First Utility (£364) and EDF Energy (£360).
Fixed tariffs can protect customers against rising prices, but have cancellation charges if they wish to switch to a different supplier.
Energy regulator Ofgem says two-thirds of customers are on standard variable tariffs, which are typically higher than fixed rate tariffs and do not have cancellation charges.
Claire Osborne, from uSwitch.com said: ""Switching tariff is incredibly easy and is definitely worth 10 minutes online, on the phone or on an app.
""You can switch without incurring any exit fees 42 days before the contract end date, and comparing and switching takes just minutes to do.""
Ofgem said that last year saw a surge in customers changing energy suppliers, with switching reaching its highest level since 2010, at about 16% of gas and electricity customers.
Of these switches, nearly half (47%) were to small or medium suppliers.
The uSwitch site is owned by property website Zoopla. It provides a free service to consumers, but charges suppliers a fee when it switches customers to them.",Half a million households could see a 51% increase in their energy bills this summer - if they simply allow their old fixed-price tariffs to roll over.
24,"Wales is also last in the UK again, behind England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in all three subject areas.
POLITICAL RESPONSE
The Welsh Conservatives said the results marked a ""decade of underachievement"" and represented a ""scandal of monumental proportions"".
Education spokesman Darren Millar AM said: ""In spite of all the tough talking and promises to do better from the first minister, today's figures place us, yet again, in the bottom half of the global education league table and re-confirm Wales' status as the worst performing school system in the UK.""
Plaid Cymru said the results showed Labour had ""failed, failed and failed again when it comes to our children's futures"".
Education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd AM urged new Education Secretary Kirsty Williams to show ""clarity of vision and an unstinting focus on delivery"".
He added: ""I urge her to stay on course in order to push through the proposed reforms and rebuild an education system fit for the next generation.""
Mark Williams MP, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, called the results  ""extremely disappointing"" but ""sadly it is not a surprise"".
""We are playing catch up and cannot afford to waste a single moment in raising standards for all pupils and schools,"" he said.
""It is no easy task, but Kirsty Williams and the Welsh Lib Dems have already proved ourselves up to the job.""
Nathan Gill of UKIP said: ""This Welsh Labour Government are guilty of many things - but their failure to equip our children for an ever more competitive 21st Century must count as one of their greatest crimes"".
EDUCATION EXPERTS
Andreas Schleicher, director of education at the OECD, said: ""It's true there is a big performance gap but there are signs of improvement, if you look at the latest mathematics results - they're going in the right direction.
""But Wales could have been where England is today - there's no reason why Wales is so far behind but I see many things in place now that are putting it on a more promising track.""
He said the country was building a new curriculum and moving from ""reform fatigue"" to people taking ownership of change, which was an important ingredient for success in the long run.
Dylan William, of the UCL Institute of Education, urged caution on the results for Wales - saying changes took a long time to filter through and it could be another decade before rankings would reflect what was happening in today's classrooms.
Gareth Evans, director of education policy at the Institute of Education, University of Wales Trinity Saint David, said the Pisa results were not as good as hoped for but not unexpected and reforms would take time to take effect.
""Pisa is important but it must be taken in the round,"" he said.
""Other performance indicators suggest Wales' education system is on the right path and we must hold our nerve.
""The Welsh Government has embarked on an ambitious transformation agenda that has the potential to make a real difference - but we must not be blown off course
TEACHING PROFESSION
David Evans from the National Union of Teachers (NUT) counselled against a new raft of reforms in response to the results.
""We must ensure that we learn one of the major lessons from the highest performing nations in Pisa, and ensure the education system of our small nation has clarity of vision and consistency of approach.
""Too often in Wales, frequently in reaction to Pisa, we have seen knee jerk reactions which have actually hindered educational progress.
""Indeed the OECD itself has criticised the Welsh Government in the past for establishing and creating 'reform fatigue' in Wales.
""With the proposals around the new curriculum, new qualifications and potential changes to the way we train teachers and utilise the supply sector, there are already big reforms on the horizon which will have positive impacts.""
Rex Philips, national officer for the NASUWT Wales accused the former education minister Leighton Andrews of turning the Pisa results of 2010 into a ""disaster zone"" for the Welsh Government.
""Huw Lewis attempted to repair the damage caused by his predecessor by acknowledging that moving to a curriculum fit for Pisa was going to take some time,"" he said.
He added Kirsty Williams ""would do well to just note the Pisa outcomes and decide whether to continue in the quest for a curriculum fit for Pisa or stand up for a curriculum that is fit for purpose for Wales.""
Rob Williams, director of policy for the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said: ""We would urge the Welsh Government to now stick to the current policy path for curriculum reform and investment in the profession.
""With the right level of committed resource, accountability that values progress and no additional initiatives on top of what school leaders are already contending with, children and young people of Wales will have the best opportunities to succeed.""
Ywain Myfyr, policy officer with Welsh teaching union UCAC said although Pisa was an international measure it was still ""a very narrow indicator"" and the results needed to be put into context.
""We certainly shouldn't let them distract us from the crucial reforms that are already in progress,"" he said.
Rachel Curley acting director of ATL Cymru, said: ""This is not the time for hand wringing or panic in response to the Pisa results. It would have been naive to expect major improvements since the last set of results four years ago"".
Tim Pratt, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said it was ""far from the doomsday scenario expected"".
""While Wales may not have gone rocketing up the rankings, it has also not slipped far behind. A rise in the maths scores has offset a slight fall in science and reading. Some other nations have fared far worse.""
BUSINESS
Neil Carberry, CBI director for people and skills policy said the drop in performance in Wales was a concern.
""The most effective response to today's findings is focusing on what works across reading, mathematics and science - high-quality school leadership and great teachers delivering an engaging curriculum which includes strong basic skills, attitudes and behaviours that can equip young people to succeed,"" he said.
""In recent years, the Welsh Government has made big efforts to turn this around - business supports these efforts, and today's results show that the government must continue its focus on delivery.""","Reaction has been coming in to the latest set of Pisa test results,  which sees Wales' 15-year-old pupils scoring below the international average in maths, reading and science for a third time."

26,"So how did the 43-year-old reach this point in his political career?
A free thinker, who led the campaign to unseat Commons Speaker Michael Martin in the last Parliament, Mr Carswell has never hidden his disdain for the ""job for life"" culture among some MPs in safe seats and the ""cosy cliques"" that dominate decision-making in government.
Most newly-elected MPs put their head down and get on with the job of climbing Westminster's greasy pole.
But the Clacton MP, who entered the Commons in 2005, refused to play the game from the start, speaking openly of his ""revulsion"" at the system and how, frankly, he was embarrassed to be an MP.
In his book, The Plan, co-authored with Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, he set out 28 steps to ""renew our broken democracy"" and ""get our supine, spineless Parliament off its knees"".
He had high hopes that David Cameron, whom he backed in the 2005 Tory leadership contest, would push through some of their proposed reforms - such as open primaries, where all voters in a constituency get to choose party candidates, and giving voters the power to recall their MP if they are doing a bad job.
But in February this year he was, along with other maverick backbench Tories, bitterly disappointed to see plans for recall powers dropped by the coalition.
He told BBC News: ""This government could have been different, but I think this marks the moment at which it becomes just another administration.""
This - together with his belief that the Conservatives were not truly committed to changing Britain's relationship with the EU - undoubtedly fed into his decision to jump ship to UKIP.
Mr Carswell has long agitated for a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU - an institution he views as being profoundly undemocratic and lacking in accountability.
He is an ardent believer in the power of the internet to revolutionise the way we are governed - by smashing open closed institutions such as the EU and handing direct democratic control to the public. He set out some of these ideas in his 2012 book, The End of Politics and the Birth of iDemocracy.
In December 2009, he introduced a bill before the House of Commons requesting a public referendum on the UK's EU membership.
And in his first week after being re-elected at the 2010 general election, he revealed he intended to force a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.
Among his rebellions, Mr Carswell tabled an amendment expressing concern over the increase in the EU budget in October 2010.
Born in 1971, Mr Carswell spent his early years living in Uganda, where his parents worked as doctors in a local hospital.
He was educated at the University of East Anglia and King's College London, and worked in digital television, investment management and the Conservative Party policy unit - run by David Cameron - before becoming an MP.
He is married to Clementine and has a daughter. In his spare time, he has said he enjoys swimming, running, gardening as well as making quince jelly.
Mr Carswell reportedly owns a Â£655 love seat in deep moss brushed cotton while his father was the inspiration for James McAvoy's character in the Last King Of Scotland, the British doctor who went to work in Uganda and found himself working for Idi Amin.
Mr Carswell first stood for Parliament in 2001, taking on Tony Blair as the Tory candidate for Sedgefield. Despite apologising for coming second he still managed to cut Mr Blair's majority by more than 7,500 votes.
In 2005 he was elected as MP for Harwich, defeating Labour's candidate by just 920 votes. By 2010 he defeated the same opponent by 12,000 votes - although boundary changes had seen the seat renamed Clacton.
During that contest UKIP did not field a candidate, supporting what they saw as the re-election of a kindred spirit.
Mr Carswell went on to gain a reputation as an outspoken Tory moderniser, influencing initiatives such as David Cameron's Big Society and campaigning for the reform of parliamentary expenses following the 2009 scandal.
He once told the BBC he was attracted to politics because ""our democracy is being undermined, with remote and unaccountable elites making the key decisions that affect our lives"".
Adding to his other accolades, the MP revealed on Twitter in January that he had brought down a suspected shoplifter in his constituency.
""You probably don't want to hear this, but I'm your local MP,"" he reportedly told the individual.
Mr Carswell's bold announcement may not have been out of character, but he said the decision to leave the Conservative Party has given him sleepless nights.
He has vowed to fight on for ""fundamental change in British politics"" - something he now believes only UKIP can deliver.
In the by-election on 9 October, Mr Carswell won 60% of the total number of votes cast, and secured a majority of 12,404.
Addressing local voters after his victory, he said: ""I resigned from parliament to face this election because I answer first, foremost and last to you. You are my boss. I will not let you down.""
""To my new party I offer these thoughts: humility when we win, modesty when we are proved right. If we speak with passion, let it always be tempered by compassion.""","Douglas Carswell has made history by becoming UKIP's first elected MP, after winning the Clacton by-election he triggered after defecting from the Conservatives with a majority of 12,404."
27,"Despite his reputation as a literary recluse, the collection - at the University of East Anglia - shows he also enjoyed trips to Niagara Falls.
It consists of 50 letters and four postcards written to the late Donald Hartog, from London, from 1986 to 2002.
They have been made public to mark the first anniversary of Salinger's death.
He died on 27 January last year at the age of 91.
In the letters, the American author said he hoped that when Henman faced German opponents at Wimbledon he ""knocked 'em all down"".
He also praised Henman's mother and father, saying they were not archetypal ""professional tennis parents"".
And he told his friend Mr Hartog he preferred Burger King burgers to those from other chains because they were  flame-grilled, making them ""better than just edible"".
Mr Hartog's daughter Frances, who donated the collection to the university, said: ""There is tremendous warmth and affection towards my father and this is so different to the man Salinger is often portrayed as.
""The letters have been sitting in a drawer but hopefully, by being in the archive, they will show people another side to him.""
Mr Hartog and Salinger met as teenagers in Vienna where they had been sent by their families to learn German.
""I think there was this extra bond between my father and Salinger because they met before the war,"" Ms Hartog added.
In March last year, another collection of unseen letters written by Salinger - to friend and former neighbour E Michael Mitchell - was displayed at a New York museum.","JD Salinger was a fan of tennis player Tim Henman and enjoyed eating burgers, previously unseen letters written by the Catcher in the Rye author show."

29,"He spoke after briefing the Security Council about his first trip to Syria since taking the post on 1 September.
Mr Brahimi said he would return soon, but admitted he did not have a full plan on how to bring peace to Syria.
The statement comes as violence continues across the country. Activists said the government was bombing parts of the second city, Aleppo.
Speaking at UN headquarters in New York, Mr Brahimi said: ""There is no disagreement anywhere that the situation in Syria is extremely bad and getting worse, that it is a threat to the region and a threat to peace and security in the world.""
He said there was ""no prospect for today or tomorrow to move forward"".
But he added: ""I think that we will find an opening in the not too distant future."" Mr Brahimi said he believed ""reasonable people"" would know that they cannot go backwards.
The BBC's Barbara Plett at the UN says Mr Brahimi's mission to forge a political solution seems almost impossible, with the two parties intent on fighting rather than talking, and the Security Council deeply divided.
The UN says more than 20,000 people have been killed since anti-government protests began in Syria in March 2011. Activists put the death toll as high as 30,000.
Also on Monday, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad blamed the violence on foreign-backed ""terrorist groups"".
He told the BBC that Syria was carrying ""a message of peace and national reconciliation"" to the UN's General Assembly, which starts its annual debate on Tuesday.
On Monday, the Local Co-ordination Committees, an opposition activist network, reported that at least 40 people had died in fighting, including 13 in Aleppo.
The group said the victims included three children from one family killed in air strikes in the central district of Maadi.
Battles also raged overnight in the western districts of Jamilia, Bustan al-Qasr, Furqan and Zabdiya, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group. The army also shelled rebel positions in Marjah and Tariq al-Bab, it added.
The state news agency Sana said the army had ""cleansed"" parts of the Arqoub, Jadida, Suleiman al-Halabi and Karm al-Jabal areas of Aleppo on Monday. Troops seized ammunition, dismantled explosive devices and ""killed a large number of terrorists"", it added.
A five-year-old girl and a man were killed during the bombardment of the southern town of Dael, in Deraa province, the Observatory reported. Six soldiers also died when a bomb exploded beside a lorry transporting them in Deraa.
Clashes between government forces and rebels were also reported in the north-eastern and north-western districts of the capital, Damascus.
More than 260,000 Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries, the UN says. There are also thought to be more than 1.2 million internally displaced people, and 2.5 million in need of humanitarian assistance.
The Security Council has so far been unable to reach agreement on how to respond to the crisis, with Russia and China blocking three Western-backed resolutions seeking to pressure President Assad to end the violence and begin talks with the opposition.
On Sunday, representatives of 20 opposition parties tolerated by the authorities attended a conference in Damascus where they called on both sides to end the violence immediately.
Raja al-Nasser, one of the organisers of the Syria Salvation Conference, called for an ""immediate halt to the shooting, a halt to the brutal and barbaric shelling, a truce and a pause for the fighters"".
A truce could ""open the way for a political process... which guarantees a radical political change, an end to the current regime and a serious and genuine democracy,"" he said.
The appeal was dismissed by the rebel Free Syrian Army, which said the meeting was a ""silly plot to mislead the international community to think there is a negotiation in place"".","The situation in Syria is ""extremely bad and getting worse"", UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has said."
30,"Plans for the facility to be built at the Alan Higgs Centre, in Coventry, will be considered on Thursday.
The Sky Blues' youth players use the centre and its programme will get Â£620,000 of Premier League funding for the coming season.
Wasps has previously said the football club could share the proposed centre.
Coventry City says any reduction in the hours its youth players could use facilities, may diminish the status of its development programme in the eyes of the Football Association (FA).
The Sky Blues' lease at the centre expires at the end of June 2017 and an extension has not yet been agreed.
Chris Anderson, Coventry City's managing director, says Wasps' plans for the Allard Way site ""might mean an end"" for the academy and are among factors which ""severely hamper the club generally"".
Factors affecting Coventry
Prof Chris Brady, a football expert at Salford Business School, said: ""Lack of training time would be a serious, possibly not insurmountable, obstacle.
""The real issue would be a lack of control and therefore, confidence in the future.""
He added fans' attendances dictated the club's turnover and its prospects.
""Lower turnover equals lower wage bill, equals lower league position, equals lower attendances in a vicious cycle,"" Prof Brady said.
Asked if the club may again have to find another home ground because of these factors - after a groundshare with Northampton in the 2013-14 season - Mr Anderson said: ""Possibly, but it's too early to tell.""
The rugby club's chief executive David Armstrong previously said the Sky Blues had been offered the chance to use the indoor ""kicking barn"" at the proposed centre when Wasps were not using it.
The plans include three pitches, the indoor pitch, gymnasium, video analysis suite, hydrotherapy recovery area and physiotherapy rooms.
The proposals will be considered by Coventry City Council, which would not comment until after they were discussed on Thursday.","Coventry City's youth academy is under threat if rugby club Wasps gets permission for a new training centre, the football club has warned."

More tries than in any year since 1999. A world ranking of five for the first time ever.
Mark Dodson, Scottish Rugby's chief executive, doesn't have much hair, but the bit that's there was on fire for the early years in the job when debt and rancour ruled against a backdrop of a game, and a business, in crisis.
Dodson doesn't exactly come in the door at Murrayfield every morning singing Hakuna Matata, but things are better than they used to be.
Ian McGeechan ran out of support and gave up his post as Scotland coach without so much of a murmur of protest from fans. Matt Williams, his replacement, was run out of town. Frank Hadden lost authority long before his exit. Andy Robinson lost it spectacularly after defeat by Tonga and resigned the next day.
Vern Cotter's departure was unique. He was serenaded out the door. All of Murrayfield applauded him on that final Six Nations Saturday against Italy. The big man, for whom expressing emotion is akin to pulling teeth, almost cracked amid the love-bombing.
Dodson had a dilemma last summer. He knew that Glasgow's Gregor Townsend was being coveted by foreign clubs and he also knew that Cotter hadn't committed in writing to staying on until the World Cup in 2019. He felt he had a decision to make.
""I'm very proud of Vern, he's done a terrific job,"" says Dodson. ""He's held in high regard by the players and you could see that from the finale he was given. But last summer, when the decision was announced, we were in a delicate place. We had the best young Scottish coach in Gregor, and we also had a successful Scotland coach in Vern.
""When I came here I promised the board that I would develop Scottish talent and I had, in Gregor, an outstanding Scottish coach. It was the time for me to make that decision and bring Gregor into the national fold.
""Gregor knows all these players, he's actually brought through a lot of them. We're going to build on the successful foundations that Vern has laid in place and I think Gregor will take the team on to the next level.
""There's gambles in professional sport all the time, but what we've done here is bring through the right guy at the right time.""
They might have made the quarter-final of the European Challenge Cup, but Edinburgh remain a project stuck in the starting stalls.
As a Pro12 team they are again in the midst of a failed season, sitting ninth in the table having lost 14 of their 18 league games this season, a dismal run that cost Alan Solomons his job earlier in the campaign and which did for Duncan Hodge's chances of succeeding him. Richard Cockerill will become their new coach in the summer.
Dodson doesn't sugar-coat how dismal Edinburgh have been. Since the beginning of the Pro12 they have finished eighth, 11th, 10th, eighth, ninth and they'll be either ninth or 10th again this season.
""Winning is everything and it's very difficult to get momentum unless they're winning consistently and what Edinburgh have done is win inconsistently,"" he says. ""They've had wonder games against Stade Francais and Harlequins and made a European final (in 2015), but their bread and butter is the Pro12 and they've failed to deliver.
""We had to put our foot on the ball and regroup. We got Richard. He had to think really clearly about coming to Edinburgh and he had offers in France and England. This is a guy who has won three Premierships. He's chosen to come here with his family and that says a lot about his belief in what we can do.
""I'm not interested in the shooting star performances. They have no interest for me. Edinburgh have to start winning Pro12 matches.
""I'm in touch with Richard about two or three times a week. He's built successful sides so he understands what's required. He won't make any snap judgements on anything until he gets here. He wants to see what it looks like. The SRU board are very clear that Edinburgh have to be successful - and they have the resources to be successful.""
Glasgow and Edinburgh exist under the same umbrella, but as organisations they're poles apart. Dodson reckons that Glasgow are three years further down the road.
He says there's no vast difference in budget between the two. The extras that Glasgow get have been earned on the back of their considerable success.
If they win their Champions Cup quarter-final against champions Saracens on Sunday, another £300,000 will be deposited in the SRU account. It would be a massive upset against a frighteningly good side, but Glasgow have won respect all around Europe.
They travel in hope - and in huge numbers. More than 5,000 fans are heading south; an unthinkable number only a few years ago.
""There will be a lot of nervous people down in Barnet on Sunday,"" says Dodson of the Saracens faithful. ""And it's a testament to Glasgow - 5,000 travelling supporters is an extraordinary number. Their brand is growing all the time and we need to respond to that.
""We have to get Scotstoun bigger because we have the capacity 7,300 there for nearly every game this season and we could probably have sold 10,000 for some of the bigger games.
""We have to find a way of increasing capacity, we have to offer people in Glasgow who haven't been to a rugby game a way of coming to see us. We don't own the stadium, but our partners have been super-supportive so far. We're talking to them about how we can make it bigger and more permanent and they've been terrific.
""Hopefully over the next 12 months we'll be able to see more seats in that stadium. It's front and centre on our minds.""
Dave Rennie, the celebrated Kiwi, will replace Townsend at Scotstoun next season. To say that his capture is a coup wouldn't be over-stating it. Rennie coached the New Zealand Under-20s to three straight World Championship wins from 2008 to 2010 and the won back-to-back Super Rugby titles with the Chiefs in 2012 and 2013.
He'll have current Scotland attack coach Jason O'Halloran as his assistant. It's a seriously impressive coaching ticket.
""If you talk to people who have played under him and people who have coached with him, this is a very special guy,"" Dodson explains. ""Myself and Scott Johnson (SRU director of rugby) went to Cape Town to talk to him while the Chiefs were playing the Stormers. We said, 'Don't talk to anybody else, talk to us, this is our plan.' Nobody saw it coming.""
A mountain of business had to be done to keep many of Scotland's marquee names from being lured away to England and France. Some, like Josh Strauss, are leaving, but Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour, Alex Dunbar, WP Nel and others have signed new deals.
The SRU have also negotiated the capture of Huw Jones for Glasgow. Smart work, that.
""It cost us financially, but players are buying into the Glasgow story and what we want to do with Edinburgh,"" adds Dodson. ""Instead of just being told about it, they can see the changes, they can see that Glasgow are at the business end of Europe and have a coach of the calibre of Dave coming in. They can also see that Edinburgh is starting to have a different coaching outlook for the future with investment going into Myreside.
""We had to pay more to keep them in Scotland, no question about it, but we didn't pay as much as these players could have achieved by going elsewhere. Each of the major guys could have got hundreds of thousands pounds more at other clubs than what they've settled for here. There was real money out there for those players. They've decided to stay here rather than go in search of gold. That's a testament to the players.""
Some of these players are going to be touring new territory from 2020. A deal just thrashed out has put Scotland back among the elite nations in summer tour terms.
The next decade has been mapped out, but the details haven't yet been published. Scotland, though, will tour New Zealand, South Africa and Australia for two and three-Test tours in those years, an undertaking they backed away from previously.
""We've got Scotland back on the tier one schedule, which is the best thing for the country,"" says Dodson. ""We'll still be touring tier two nations but this means a lot more games against the top teams in the summer and it also means that they are going to come here more often.""","For much of rugby's professional age, Murrayfield has been a whirling vortex of disappointment, a place where, at the beginning of nearly every Six Nations and nearly every November series, almost 70,000 were fed into the place in an optimistic and joyful frame of mind only to emerge two hours later like the man on the bridge in Edvard Munch's Scream."

It will be on display until 19 June in Bodelwyddan Castle.
The book of remembrance, unveiled in 1928, is around 1,100 pages long and is normally held in the crypt at the Temple of Peace in Cardiff.

34,"Rebels said the attack - which reportedly left four people dead and many injured - was carried out by government forces using chlorine gas.
The UN special envoy for Syria said a chlorine attack, if confirmed, would amount to a ""war crime"".
Footage obtained by the BBC shows people with breathing difficulties receiving treatment at a hospital.
Men, women and children are shown being fitted with oxygen masks by medical staff.
The gas is thought to have been chlorine dropped in a barrel bomb, said the Syrian Civil Defence - volunteer emergency response workers who operate in opposition-held areas.
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura confirmed the global body's experts were investigating reports of a gas, believed to be chlorine, being dropped on Aleppo.
""There is a lot of evidence that it actually did take place,"" he told reporters. ""If it did take place, it is a war crime and as such it would require everyone... to address it immediately.""
A man receiving treatment in hospital said he had been in the Zebdieh area of the city, where he lives, when two missiles landed near him and a group of friends.
""And a few minutes later, the smell of gas started spreading... and I felt my eyes burning and difficulties in breathing,"" he said. ""The smell was very strong - beyond any description.""
A medic at the hospital said they had received a lot of casualties, who were ""all ages"" including children and elderly people.
""When we examined these casualties, we realised it was due to chlorine,"" he added.
Chlorine is a common industrial chemical, but its use in weapons is banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention.
In 2013, the BBC found strong evidence suggesting residents of Saraqeb had been subject to a chemical attack by government helicopters, something denied by the Syrian authorities.
Fighting has escalated in Aleppo in recent days, with rebels severing the government's main route to the west of the city.
The offensive sought to break a siege by pro-government forces, who encircled the east in July with the support of Russian aircraft.
Russia has announced a daily halt to hostilities between 10:00 (07:00 GMT) and 13:00 from Thursday, to allow in aid.
But UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator Stephen O'Brien said while that would be taken seriously, a break of up to 48 hours was needed to get enough aid in on lorries.
""We have supplies ready to roll - food rations, hospital supplies, ambulances, fuel for generators, water supplies and more.
""We will continue to use all available routes and mechanisms to do this, including cross-line and cross-border operations from Turkey.""
A witness in Aleppo told the BBC there had not been any ceasefire on Thursday, contrary to what the Russians had said.
Earlier some of the last doctors in the rebel-held east of the city appealed to US President Barack Obama to come to the aid of the 250,000 civilians there.
They said that in the past month there had been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of them on hospitals where they work.
On Monday, the UN said countless civilians had been killed or injured in Aleppo in recent weeks  and hospitals and clinics had continued to be targeted.
Moreover, attacks on civilian infrastructure had left more than two million people without electricity or access to the public water network for several days, it added.
Elsewhere, Russian planes attacked targets in the northern city of Raqqa, a stronghold of so-called Islamic State.

39,"In the months after 9/11, Americans asked: ""Why do they hate us?""
Today, European politicians, journalists and academics are still searching for an explanation as to why so many young Muslims are being radicalised.
Religion, economic deprivation and Western foreign policy are all put forward as possible drivers of jihadism. The one thing most people can agree on is that the West is unsure how to react to the so-called Islamic State (IS).
The confusion is reflected in the West's uncertain attitude towards democracy in the Arab world. A few weeks before he ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003, President George W Bush said that once Saddam Hussein had been toppled, Iraq would become ""a beacon of democracy across the Middle East"".
The neo-cons believed that the benefits of democracy were so self-evident that, given a chance, Iraqis would be bound to grasp them. It had worked in post-Soviet Eastern Europe, so why shouldn't it work in the Middle East too?
But far from embracing Western liberalism, Iraq descended into a civil war. And many in the West took away the lesson that you could not force a country to become a democracy.
And if Iraq convinced some in the West that it was not possible to impose democracy, the Arab Spring revived the issue of whether the West actually wants democracy in the Middle East. Or is it, in fact, frightened of what democracy might bring?
For decades jihadists - like many Western liberals - have argued that the West's endless rhetoric about democracy is hollow. After all, they ask, don't the human rights-abusing Saudi royals get Western backing?
And how come Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak was bankrolled by US aid?
And they cite 1992 in Algeria as perhaps the clearest case of Western double standards. When the Islamic Salvation Front was on track to win parliamentary elections, there were almost audible sighs of relief in Western capitals when the army intervened, banned the party and detained many of its members.
The fear of radical Islamists winning power is felt perhaps most acutely in Israel. It may be the Middle East's most developed democracy, but what would happen if the hostility of many Arabs to Israel found democratic expression?
If Middle Eastern governments did what their people wanted, Israel would have a problem.
The issue was most sharply exposed when Hamas won the election in the Palestinian territories in 2006. Israeli and Western officials all refused to meet their newly elected representatives on the grounds that they wanted the destruction of Israel.
Within a few months, many of Hamas's elected representatives were in Israeli prisons.
Bahrain: Protests broke out in 2011, with demonstrators demanding more democracy and an end to discrimination against the majority Shia community by the Sunni-led state. King Hamad crushed dissent, with help from troops of neighbouring states. He later accepted recommendations of a commission of inquiry, but critics say this was not acted on and abuses continued.
Egypt: Mass protests forced President Mubarak to resign in February 2011, after three decades in power. The Muslim Brotherhood won parliamentary and presidential elections, but President Mohammed Morsi quickly generated huge public anger by granting himself far-reaching powers and pushing through an Islamist-flavoured constitution. After millions of anti-Morsi protesters took to the streets, the army ousted him. The subsequent election was won by former army chief Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, riding a wave of popularity. His government has since declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organisation, imprisoning many of its leaders as well as secular and liberal critics.
Libya: Anti-government demonstrations in February 2011 evolved into an armed revolt against the four-decade-long rule of Col Muammar Gaddafi. Western powers intervened to support rebels after the UN Security Council authorised ""all necessary measures"" to protect civilians. Col Gaddafi fled Tripoli and was captured and killed by rebels in August 2011. A subsequent battle for power and resources led to repeated clashes among rival militias, the expulsion of the internationally recognised government from the capital and the division of Libya into rival fiefdoms.
Syria: Streets protests in 2011 against the rule of Bashar al-Assad briefly seemed likely to topple the president. But as a peaceful uprising mutated into armed opposition and then an increasingly sectarian conflict, foreign powers were drawn in, seeking either to defend or destroy the Assad government. The militant group IS, formed in Iraq, took advantage of the instability to carve out territory for itself in northern and eastern Syria. Thousands have died in the conflict, and millions have fled Syria as refugees.
Tunisia: Birthplace of the Arab Spring, in December 2010, when young, unemployed Mohamed Bouazizi set fire to himself after officials stopped him selling vegetables, sparking mass protests. The resignation and flight of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali has been followed by the first democratic parliamentary and presidential elections in Tunisian history. Political assassinations and fatal attacks on tourists have followed, but Tunisia is often held up as the Arab country that has emerged best from the ousting of a long-time leader.
Yemen: President Ali Abdullah Saleh was the fourth Arab leader to be forced from power. But his departure from office did not lead to the end of his influence, and he remained in Yemen, forming an alliance of convenience with former enemies, the Houthi rebels, against Saudi Arabian forces and others. His successor as president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, has been unable to impose his authority on the country, which remains divided among competing armed factions, including the local branch of al-Qaeda.
The Muslim Brotherhood's successive election victories in post-Mubarak Egypt once again exposed the West's dilemma. Let's not forget that both IS and al-Qaeda reject the Brotherhood's position that Islamists should seek power through the ballot box.
But fearing a Brotherhood challenge to their own authority, the autocrats in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf persuaded the West that they could not take the risk of an Egypt governed by President Morsi.
The Egyptian army, together with street protesters who wanted to overturn the election result, looked like the safer bet.
It was a policy born of perhaps understandable caution. How could Western leaders trust the Brotherhood's assurances that its first election victory would not be followed by an attempt to grasp power more permanently as a prelude to constructing its stated goal - an Islamic State?
But by failing to back the Brotherhood government, the West handed radical Islamists a victory. ""There is no point voting for the Brotherhood,"" they could now argue, ""because they will be kept out of power even if they win. You might as well fight with us instead.""
In fact, political developments in Tunisia suggest that democracy can be trusted to work. The Muslim Brotherhood equivalent there - Ennahda - won the post-Arab Spring election and then proved willing to compromise.
In a move no secular party in Tunisia would be likely to emulate, Ennahda voluntarily stepped down from power in the interests of securing broad agreement on a new constitution.
But Tunisia was always a sideshow. Egypt matters more. And with the liberals' and Brotherhoods' leaders thrown into President Sisi's prisons, the field was left clear for the jihadists to offer the only clear argument about how to resist Cairo's oppressive government.
These issues affect the region as a whole. The contradictions are now most pressing in Syria. Western governments are still calling for the downfall of President Assad but hesitate to do much to bring it about for fear of what his departure might bring.
What would a post-Assad Syria look like? What would Syrian elections bring? Might Sunni Islamists come to power? How would that suit the West? And Israel?
That the West has been unable to transform the yearning for democracy, freedom and security in the Middle East into defeats for IS and al-Qaeda is in part a result of the contradiction inherent in arguing for democracy but fearing its results.",The Paris attacks have once again revealed the West's bewilderment as to why it is under attack.

41,"Dr Rebecca Payne said there is a particular problem in north Wales with GPs getting older and fewer younger doctors taking over.
The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is launching a recruitment film to trigger a change.
The Welsh government says an extra £10m is being spent on primary care.
RCGP Wales spokeswoman Dr Payne, who teaches medical students at Cardiff University and works as a GP for an out of hours service in north Wales, said it is hard to know exactly how many more GPs are needed in Wales.
""Patients are telling us they are struggling to get appointments and we are working harder and harder,"" she said.
The Welsh government said, overall, GP numbers in Wales have increased by 11% between 2003 and 2013.
But the RCGP reckons more GPs will be needed across the UK as the aging population continues to grow.
Its film aims to ""tackle media stereotypes of general practice as less stimulating and exciting than other medical careers"".
Meanwhile, Health Minister Mark Drakeford has announced that an extra £6m will be spent over the next year to help healthcare professionals and free up GP time look after people with more complex needs. Another £4m will be spent on improving access to community care.
In all, 64 primary care ""clusters"" have been set up across Wales of GP practices working with pharmacists, dentists, optometrists, therapists, nurses and healthcare workers.
They will run a primary care support team to provide locum cover or offer training and advice to manage local service pressures among other things.

42,"Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation (Pace) says ""thousands"" of children are affected and police forces lack skills to deal with such abuse.
A report into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham found at least 1,400 children were abused over two decades.
The National Child Protection Working Group says police are dealing with an ""unprecedented"" number of abuse cases.
Child sexual exploitation can take place when a young person is manipulated by an adult into sex following a process of ""grooming"", involving being given gifts and being distanced from their parents.
Children may then be sexually assaulted by networks of adults over a number of years and can be shamed or intimidated out of reporting the crime.
Pace specialises in helping parents whose children have been sexually exploited.
Its director Fleur Strong told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""a significant number"" of families were currently trying to cope with a child being sexually exploited.
She said: ""I can show you families from Torquay to Exeter to Norfolk, there are families in Edinburgh, Belfast, all of them who will be suffering from this type of crime that lasts for many families for years and years.
""I would say that without doubt there are thousands of families being affected today. This type of child abuse is in every town.""
In September, West Yorkshire Police began a fresh investigation into the case of a girl who was groomed from the age of 13 and was trafficked to towns in the region.
Her mother, who for legal reasons can only be identified as ""Sarah"", said the process began in 2007 and her ""world fell apart"" because of her daughter's ordeal.
""We used to beg her not to go out, because she was begging and pleading and then actually took a knife to herself and said she would harm herself if she couldn't get out of the house,"" Sarah explained.
""These men had such a hold over her, that was it, they had her.""
Sarah said she repeatedly called the police but no proper action was taken and on occasions her daughter and the family were themselves ""blamed"".
""Some officers would say [to her daughter]: 'What do you keep going back for, you must like what you are doing.'
""I was absolutely appalled, absolutely disgusted.""
Sarah's daughter fell pregnant to one of the perpetrators. None of the men who groomed her has so far been caught.
Sarah now says she has ""drawn a line"" under the previous response from the police and is now satisfied her daughter's case is being fully investigated.
West Yorkshire Police admitted it had been ""slow"" in the past to recognise the signs of child sexual exploitation, but said that was now one of the highest priorities for the force.
It is currently investigating 84 cases of alleged grooming of children.
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Foster said: ""Fundamentally we have changed the way that we've dealt with victims.
""Survivors will be listened to, they will be taken seriously and we will support them and ensure that we maximise every opportunity to bring these perpetrators to justice.""
After the scale of exploitation in Rotherham was revealed, the UK's senior police officers are now more aware of the challenges involved in investigating grooming, according to Pace.
But the charity says that front-line officers still need better training to understand how to recognise the signs of child sexual exploitation.
The organisation also criticised the legal cut-off age for Child Abduction Warning Notices, which can be used by parents in England and Wales to try to prevent a named adult having contact with their child.
Once a child living at home turns 16, the warning notices no longer have effect.
Pace highlighted the case of a 16-year-old girl in Exeter, who was allegedly groomed by men who gave her so-called legal highs.
The charity says the girl's mother ""is having a very difficult time"" as a Child Abduction Warning Notice can no longer be used.
Detective Superintendent Paul Sanford, spokesman for the National Child Protection Working Group, said the number of abuse cases being investigated was stretching police resources.
He added that this ""presents a real challenge to the police service, both in terms of finance and the number of trained and experienced personnel we need to investigate all of these cases"".
""The Children's Commissioner estimated that some 16,000 children are at high risk of being exploited for sex across our towns and cities. This is unacceptable, and we are committed to doing all we can to root it out and prevent any more of the young and vulnerable becoming victims.""","Young people are currently being groomed in ""every town"" in Britain, according to a charity."
43,"They plan to deliver a 136,000-strong petition to Downing Street and want the government to act as a guarantor.
The men had been working on a private US-owned ship providing anti-piracy protection when they were arrested over illegally possessing weapons.
They have been in jail since October and have since seen a decision over their bail deferred by the authorities.
The US maritime company AdvanFort insists their ship had the correct papers.
The petition, which is to be delivered to Number 10 on Tuesday, calls for the men to be released and asks for the UK government's backing.
Billy Irving, from Connel, Argyll; Nick Dunn, from Ashington, Northumberland; Ray Tindall from Chester; Paul Towers from Pocklington, Yorkshire; John Armstrong from Wigton, Cumbria, and Nicholas Simpson, from Catterick, North Yorkshire, were arrested on 12 October and have been in prison in India since 24 October.
They were working for AdvanFort providing anti-piracy protection in the Indian Ocean when their ship, the MV Seaman Guard Ohio, was detained.
The 35-member crew also included Indians, Ukrainians and Estonians.
The Indian authorities said they had intercepted the US ship and found weapons and ammunition on board which had not been properly declared.
AdvanFort said India's coastguard and police had allowed the ship into the port to refuel and shelter from a storm. It said all weapons had been properly registered.
Mr Irving's girlfriend, Yvonne MacHugh, who started the petition on Change.org, has urged the UK government to intervene.
Ms MacHugh said a ""security official in India"" had told her that if the UK government were to provide assurances, the men would be freed.
The 25-year-old, who will deliver the petition alongside other family members of the men, said she had just returned from India, saying it was ""the most emotional trip I have ever had to make"".
She said: ""The men had lost a lot of weight, they looked exhausted and had lost hope of ever being released, their morale is at an all-time low.""
The men have ""no idea what is going on with their case"", she said.
""It is in our government's hands to bring back these men who have fought for us as soldiers and now need the help of their country.""
Revd Canon Ken Peters, director of justice and public affairs for the Mission to Seafarers said the families of the men are ""desperately worried for their health and wellbeing"".
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""This is a difficult and important case, which the prime minister has raised with Indian ministers, as has the foreign secretary.
""We will continue to do all that we can.""
The men were visited ""regularly"", the spokesman said.
He added: ""While we are unable to demand the release of British nationals, or interfere in another country's legal processes, we continue to make very clear our interest in this case, and the importance of ensuring that it is resolved as quickly as possible.""",Relatives of six former British servicemen jailed in India are urging the prime minister to help free them.

RPC produced the first look into the way the firm was run after MPs said working practices at the Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire were closer to ""that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern High Street retailer"".
But Sports Direct said the change of heart in not using them again had come after ""shareholder feedback"" and ""subsequent consultation with a number of the company's long-standing shareholders"".
The decision produced a positive response.
Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said: ""At last Mike Ashley and his board have grasped that they need to take some very serious steps to restore shareholder, consumer and worker confidence in their employment practices.
""We have always urged, as we did at this year's AGM with the backing of investors, that an independent review is a vital component of this company truly getting to grips with its many and serious employment problems, so we are pleased that the company has now seen sense.""
Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, also welcomed the news, saying: ""This is a good start. It is a welcome and much-needed sign that the board and Sports Direct's management are listening to independent shareholders.""
Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Ashley had been keen to stress the positive aspects of working for the company and the firm remains keen to present a better image.
He said it had paid a total of £200m in bonuses in the past five years and added: ""The cleaning lady got an £80,000 bonus on top of her normal pay - nobody in the UK has done that.""
He has highlighted the firm's additional remuneration scheme in recent years.
In July 2014, Sports Direct's shareholders voted in favour of a bonus scheme to benefit up to 3,000 employees as well as Mr Ashley, although he quickly withdrew from it.
However, he also admitted his lack of intimate knowledge of the running of the business was an issue after the spotlight fell on working practices at the Shirebrook warehouse during the summer.
It was discovered staff were earning below the legal minimum wage because they were kept for near-strip searches on their way home after their paid shift had ended.
Mr Ashley said: ""You would be surprised how little I knew about what was going on and that's really where the failing was.
""How do I know what a night shift does from 12 at night to seven or eight in the morning? I don't work there on Saturdays and Sundays and there are lots of hours I am not there.
""Should I have known more? Yes. Was I aware of the some of the things that were going on? Absolutely not.""
Mr Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct and owner of Newcastle United Football Club, also explained why he commuted in the skies, rather than using more conventional methods.
""I do fly to work by helicopter,"" he said. ""I don't get paid a salary but what I do like to do is go by private plane. It saves a lot of time and it's very efficient.""
Sports Direct also on Tuesday announced that a workers' representative on the board would be elected by staff.
It added that ""it is anticipated that all staff directly engaged or employed by Sports Direct may vote"".
The company has already reacted to criticism of its working practices by pledging to abolish zero-hours contracts for its directly employed casual retail staff.
However, almost all staff at the firm's controversial Shirebrook warehouse are agency workers so their terms will remain unchanged.
Mr Ashley said: ""If they opt for 12 hours plus, they are normally doing 20 or 15 hours a week.
""They will still get those 20 or 15 hours a week, so it's just trying to get people into two categories - those who want a guaranteed minimum and those who actually don't, so you can't actually do more than that in my opinion.""","Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley has again defended the running of his firm, repeating his admission of mistakes and that it had paid millions in bonuses."
47,"The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.
The Work and Pensions Committee said continuing with it was ""unsustainable"" and ""unfair"" on younger families.
The government said it was committed to the triple-lock until 2020 at least.
Historically, pensions were linked to inflation rather than earnings, which reduced pensioner incomes relative to those of the working population.
As a result of triple-lock policy, the state pension has risen by a relatively generous £1,100 since 2010, with an increase of 2.9% in April this year.
However, MPs said that while pensioners had done well out of the triple-lock, young people and working-age families had suffered unfairly.
So-called Millennials, born between 1981 and 2000, face being the first generation in modern times to be financially worse off than their predecessors, they added.
MPs said the rising cost of the state pension - £98bn in the last tax year - was now unsustainable.
Instead of the triple-lock, they say the new state pension and basic state pension could be linked simply to average earnings.
They say a formula should also be included to protect pensioners during periods when earnings lag behind price inflation.
In those periods, pensioners would get an above-earnings increase so that their purchasing power did not decline.
Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith defended the introduction of the triple-lock in 2010 because at the time pensioners were ""most likely to be in poverty"".
But he told BBC Radio 5 live, this year alone the policy would cost £18bn more than was originally estimated so it was right to re-examine it.
Mr Duncan Smith added: ""We still want their pension to grow, but it's the question of the rate of growth that is costing so much and that now needs to be reviewed.""
The report said there was a ""trade-off"" between increasing the amount of state pension that people get and setting the age at which people receive it.
Simply increasing the state pension age risked further disadvantaging people who may already be worse off and have lower life expectancies.
Labour MP Frank Field, the chairman of the committee, said that at the same time as tightening their belts, young people were being asked to support a group that has ""fared relatively well in recent years"".
""They've accepted that unfairness so that we could largely eliminate pensioner poverty,"" he told the BBC.
""Fairness now means that the pendulum swings back in favour of working families, so they do not continue to have cuts - real cuts - in living standards, while we further advance the interests of pensioners.""
A spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: ""We want to ensure economic security for people at every stage of their life, including retirement. We are committed to the triple lock which is protecting the incomes of millions of pensioners.""
Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said pensioners were ""being blamed for the problems faced by today's younger generations"".
""This phoney conflict is being used as a smokescreen in order to cut back on the welfare state,"" she said.
""The housing crisis hasn't been caused by pensioners but because in Britain we sold off council houses, we haven't been building enough affordable homes, wages and employment are low and insecure and an economy built on house-price inflation simply cannot be sustained.
""This is what needs to be addressed.""","The ""triple-lock"" on state pensions - which has protected the incomes of the older generation since 2010 - should be scrapped, a committee of MPs has said."
48,"Five months after it was flooded during the Storm Desmond deluge, Carlisle's Sheepmount Stadium remains closed and the repair bill could reach Â£3m.
The closure is forcing athletes to travel as far as the Scottish border to find facilities, it has emerged.
Carlisle City Council said the venue could be relocated.
Pentathlon athlete Joe Connelly, 15, is among those having to travel to find adequate training tracks.
His father Chris said he was worried that sporting stars of the future might be ""lost"".
""We've a great swathe of talented young people who could represent Cumbria and the country, and we face a loss of that"", Mr Connelly said.
""Temporary solutions are just not appropriate for elite athletes.""
The stadium has a running track, gym and playing fields.
Gavin Capstick, the council's contracts and community services manager, said repairing the stadium might be the cheapest option.
But he said a better long-term solution might be to move to a part of the city less likely to be affected by floods.
He added: ""The challenge will be the availability of land and price of a new build as opposed to reinstating facilities.""",Athletes are being forced to travel hundreds of miles to train after a major sporting facility was damaged by storms.
49,"Map Maker allowed users to draw features, adding roads, rivers, green spaces and local businesses.
But some edits, such as an image of its Android mascot urinating on an Apple logo, were not as welcome.
Google said that the shutdown is ""temporary"" but admitted that it will take more than a few days to fix.
Last month, it was forced to apologise for the Android graffiti but since then, several other Map Maker hacks have been spotted.
The service had relied on a mixture of Google reviewers and trusted users to moderate Map Maker contributions, a system which, the search giant now admits, has not been adequate.
Map Maker team member Pavirthra Kanakarajan explained the decision to suspend the service in a post, linked to from the Map Maker page.
""We have been experiencing escalated attacks to spam Google Maps over the past few months... As a consequence, we suspended auto-approval and user moderation across the globe,"" she said.
""The most recent incident was particularly troubling and unfortunate - a strong user in our community chose to go and create a large scale prank on the map,"" she added.
Following the Android graffiti, Google decided that all its edits would go through a manual review process but that quickly led to a large backlog.
""Given the current state of the system, we have come to the conclusion that it is not fair to any of our users to let them continue to spend time editing. Every edit you make is essentially going to a backlog that is growing very fast,"" said Ms Kanakarajan.
""We believe that it is more fair to only say that if we do not have the capacity to review edits at roughly the rate they come in, we have to take a pause.""
Google introduced Map Maker in 2008 as a tool to allow users to edit the information on the service, similar to the way Wikipedia allows users to edit its pages.
Another high profile recent hack saw ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden placed in the White House, via a new business called Edward's Snow Den.
""That wasn't a Map Maker issue but rather a problem with how Google deals with local listings,"" explained Ms Kanakarajan.","Google is suspending a service that allowed members of the public to contribute to its maps, following vandalism."
50,"The parents of Hope Lee had known for months she would have a short lifespan due to a deadly brain and skull condition.
Emma and Andrew Lee, from Newmarket, agreed Hope's kidneys would be made available for transplant.
Mr Lee said: ""There's an adult lady out there who is doing very well, so a lot of good has come out of it.""
Hope was born at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, last week ahead of her twin brother Josh, as first reported in the Cambridge News.
Her parents found out she had a condition called anencephaly in the 13th week of pregnancy and they rejected having her terminated.
Mr Lee said: ""It was a very sad time, but our whole family are signed-up for organ donation.
""We had time to plan everything we wanted to do and the hospital was able to put into action the transplant of the kidneys and some liver cells were taken as well.""
Source: NHS Organ Donation
Hope's father said if they had not planned it in advance, they might not have been able to go through with the organ donation plan after Hope was born.
""Just before she died she bent her fingers around my finger and I broke down,"" he said.
""Seventy four minutes isn't long, but it has given us a chance for a bit of closure.""
Sally Johnson, NHS Blood and Transplant director, said: ""It is exceptionally rare for very young babies to become organ donors.

51,"The green belt site on the west side of Mill Lane at Bathampton Meadows was chosen by Bath and North East Somerset Council (Banes), on Wednesday night.
It was selected over neighbouring council-owned land, because the 800-car site would be less visible and have potential for a future rail link.
But landowner Steve Horler said there was ""absolutely no way"" he would sell.
The National Trust has also opposed the plans saying they would ""cause significant harm"" and ""scar the landscape for many years into the future"".
The site, according to Banes, was not only chosen because it was close to the city centre but was ""well-located for cars coming from the A4, A46 and A363"".
But Mr Horler, who runs a holiday let business on his farm, said he ""doesn't want to see this beautiful part of Bath destroyed""
""I've got a really successful business in Bathampton Meadows,"" he said.
""Thousands of people come to enjoy this area every year. They want me to sell it but there's absolutely no way I'm going to.""

""In Bath we're talking about producing 11,000 jobs and these people have to get to work - get in and out - and the city's full up,"" he said.
The National Trust added it was aware of the impact of traffic and pollution within the city itself but was concerned this development would harm views from nearby Solsbury Hill which it cares for.
""Whether for 800 or 1,200 cars, it is clear that this scale of development would scar the landscape for many years into the future and would mar the wonderful views experienced from Solsbury Hill, which is part of the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty,"" a spokesman said.

He ran the now-defunct Public Interest Lawyers (PIL) and had 12 charges of misconduct proved against him.
The Insolvency Service website states Mr Shiner, 60, from Birmingham, was made bankrupt on Tuesday.

The solicitor had denied or partially admitted the charges, which were found proved against him by a panel of the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. He was struck off in February.
A property in Birmingham, which the Insolvency Service lists as his address, was transferred to his daughters for £300,000 in January.
The service said the sale of the house and any other transfer of assets would be subject to investigation to ensure his creditors recoup as much of the money owed to them as possible.
An Insolvency Service spokesman said: ""We would want to know what has happened to any money received for the house. The Official Receiver checks all transactions over a five-year period before bankruptcy. We would investigate that sale.""
In five of the charges, he was found to have acted dishonestly, including agreeing to pay ""sweeteners"" to a fixer, understood to be Abu Jamal, to persuade him to change his evidence to the £31m Al-Sweady Inquiry.
Investigations that originated from Mr Shiner and the PIL law firm would be assessed and a decision reached over which cases should no longer be pursued, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat) said.
Ihat is due to close this summer. It is independent of the military chain of command for the purposes of its investigations, the government services website said.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has paid out more than £100m on legal costs and compensation linked to the war in Iraq, with a large proportion of this over allegations brought by PIL.
An MoD spokesman said: ""The evidence we submitted on Phil Shiner's abuse of our legal system saw him struck off and, with his conduct discredited, we announced the closure of Ihat.
""We intend to recover as much as possible from defending these claims and await the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal full decision before deciding our next steps.""",A lawyer who brought false claims against Iraq War veterans has been declared bankrupt.

The University of Leicester paper concludes that ""clearly gliding using a batcape is not a safe way to travel"".
But the four students, all Batman fans, said the superhero would be able to fly safely if he used a larger cape.
David Marshall, one of the students, said: ""We found he could fly quite well and he can actually fly pretty far.
""He can get about twice as far as he does fall, but once he gets there he is travelling about 50mph and that's a bit too fast to land safely.
""He would likely end up getting a bit splattered.""
In Batman Begins the superhero uses a cape which becomes rigid when a current is passed through it.
The students' paper, called

59,"The claim: Labour was ahead in the polls before the leadership process started.
Reality Check verdict: Labour has been ahead in only three of the 75 polls conducted between Mr Corbyn becoming leader and the end of June.
""Over the past year we have won the by-elections we contested, three with a big swing to Labour, we got ahead of the Tories in the local government election, we won four mayoral contests and were indeed ahead of [sic] the polls until such time as a number of people decided to have a leadership contest instead,"" Mr Corbyn said.
Let's take a look at those claims in turn.
There have been four by-elections since the last general election, all of them in seats that were previously held by Labour. The swings to Labour were 7%, 6%, -1% and 9%.
In the first four by-elections of the last parliament, three of the swings to Labour were in double figures, so the swings are smaller than they were five years ago, but not a huge amount smaller.
Labour remained ahead of the Conservatives in the local government elections in England in 2016 with 1,326 council seats compared with the Tories' 842 seats.
There was some criticism of Labour's performance because they ended up with 18 fewer seats than they had the last time these councils were contested in 2012, although the party had been expected to lose many more seats.
It was nonetheless the first time outside a general election year since 1985 that the main opposition party had lost seats in the annual council elections.
So, while Mr Corbyn's assertion is accurate it does not tell the full story.
Labour has indeed won the four mayoral contests in the past year: in London, Bristol, Salford and Liverpool.
The London mayor was a gain from the Tories, in Bristol Labour's candidate defeated an independent incumbent, while Salford and Liverpool were both Labour holds.
Finally, Mr Corbyn said that Labour had been ahead in the polls until ""people decided to have a leadership election"".
It would be reasonable to take that point as the day of the EU referendum, because it was after that that the moves began for the vote of no confidence and the leadership challenges. Between 12 September when Mr Corbyn became leader and the end of June there have been 75 voting intention polls carried out.
Of those, Labour has been ahead in three, all conducted in March and April by YouGov.
But looking at an average of the polls, the Conservatives have been ahead since the 2015 general election.","At the Labour leadership hustings in Gateshead on Thursday, Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith were discussing Labour's electability."

Africa remains enthralled by the tournament, which has steadily grown to become the continent's biggest sporting event, and the 2017 finals are guaranteed to provide a mix of flair, surprise, controversy and historic moments.
Gabon welcomes back the cream of African football only five years after it co-hosted the Nations Cup with Equatorial Guinea.
The country was awarded the finals by the Confederation of African Football as replacement for Libya, which had been due to host in 2013 but swapped years with South Africa which had been selected to host in 2017.
The civil war in Libya meant it had to withdraw entirely and in stepped Gabon.
However, the oil-rich country with a population of 1.8m has been experiencing its own troubles since incumbent President Ali Bongo was declared the winner of a contested election in August. His victory was followed by deadly clashes on the streets.
Opposition activists have called on citizens to boycott the tournament as part of their plans to highlight their protests against Bongo's rule.
On the pitch, Gabon are the lowest ranked team in the finals, occupying 108th spot in Fifa's world rankings for January.
But they do have in their side one of the world's most coveted strikers in Pierre-Emerick Aubamenyang. The Borussia Dortmund forward goes into the tournament in scintillating form, having scored 20 goals in 22 games this season for his German club.
As well as Aubameyang, many eyes will be on reigning BBC African Footballer of the Year and Caf African Footballer of the year Riyad Mahrez and Africa's most expensive player Sadio Mane.
Leicester winger Mahrez will be a key figure in an Algeria team which until recently had been ranked the best team in Africa.
Mane, who cost Liverpool £34m, leads the line for Senegal. The Teranga Lions have never won the event but Mane could be the key to changing that statistic.
Twenty three players from English Premier League clubs will be in Gabon including Mahrez, Mane, Manchester United's Ivorian defender Eric Bailly, West Ham's Ghanaian Andre Ayew, Leicester's Algerian Islam Slimani and Crystal Palace's Ivorian Wilfried Zaha.
Winger Zaha has only just switched international allegiance from England and started his career with the Elephants in sensational style by scoring on his second appearance for the team in a friendly against Uganda earlier this week.
Egypt's Mohamed Salah has been outstanding since his switch from Chelsea to Italian giants Roma. Once labelled the African Messi, the winger has recently recovered from injury but if he can find his best form he could light up the tournament.
At the other end of the spectrum, Guinea-Bissau skipper Bocundji Ca was playing for third division French club Paris FC last season.
Togo coach Claude LeRoy is making a record-extending ninth appearance at the finals and leading a sixth different nation. The Frenchman, considered the Godfather of the Nations Cup, has won the tournament once - with Cameroon in 1988 - and has only once failed to reach the quarter-finals stage.
Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary can become the oldest player in the tournament's history - if he gets some game time in Gabon. The veteran shot stopper turns 44 on 15 January. Compatriot Hossam Hassan holds the record - he was 39 when he played in 2006.
The Pharaohs have won the tournament a record seven times and they have a chance to further pull away from the pack for the first time since their last success in 2010. Failure to qualify for the last three editions has marred their recent past and they will relish the chance to re-establish themselves at the top table.
Herve Renard is aiming to become the first coach to win the title with three different teams. The Frenchman lifted the trophy with Zambia in 2012 and led Ivory Coast to glory last time out.
He is aiming to make it a hat-trick with Morocco. Only two coaches have won the Cup of Nations three times - Charles Gyamfi achieved the feat in charge of Ghana in 1963, 1965 and 1982 and Hassan Shehata also won it three times with Egypt between 2006 and 2010.
Guinea-Bissau are making their first appearance at the finals. Their qualification is virtually the stuff of fairytales: one of the world's poorest countries overcoming 2012 champions to top their group, having previously won only four of 32 matches in their history.
With a squad almost entirely made of expatriates who are based in the lower leagues of Portugal, few expect Guinea-Bissau's run to continue but what a story it is already.
It is the first time in 39 years that Uganda are at the tournament. And in a curious twist of fate they are paired in a group with Ghana, who were hosts in 1978 - the last time Uganda qualified - and beat the Cranes 2-0 in the final.
Uganda were named National Team of the Year at the recent Caf awards and goalkeeper Denis Onyango was named Africa-based Player of the Year. They are a team on the rise but it would be a major shock if they went deep into the tournament.
""When I view the Algeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal squads, I realise we are not among the best on paper, but there will be 23 highly committed Togolese footballers at the Cup of Nations."" Togo captain and striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who has been without a club since his release by Crystal Palace in June 2016.
""We are victims of blackmail."" - Cameroon official Simon Lyonga is unhappy with European club managers who he believes privately encourage their players to reject call-ups to play in the Nations Cup. Eight Cameroonians, including Liverpool defender Joel Matip, opted out.
""With these kind of decisions they are controlling every second so, for sure, they are going to win the African Cup."" - Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho vented his anger at Ivory Coast's refusal to delay the departure of centre-back Eric Bailly by 24 hours so he could play against West Ham.
""The fact that I have had a lot of success in recent years also makes people think that alone can make the difference. But that doesn't matter, what matters is the spirit of the team and the way we go into our matches."" - Morocco coach Herve Renard plays down his own influence on proceedings.
""There aren't many differences between coaching in Europe and Africa except that one day you might be having lunch with the head of state and then the next day you are standing alongside some dusty field looking at a prospective player.""- Togo coach Claude LeRoy on the particular demands of managing on the continent.
""Avram Grant has taken us as his children, always checking on us, how conditioned we are. Even if you aren't part of the team he motivates you to train harder and get much playing time in your team."" - Ghana's Afriyie Acquah is full of praise for the former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who is widely expected to lose his job after the tournament no matter whether he leads the Black Stars to a first title in 35 years or not.
Reigning champions Ivory Coast have a new-look squad following the international retirements of legendary players such as Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba. They struggled in qualifying but the same was true before they won the trophy two years ago. New recruit Zaha is tipped to be used as the main striker for the Elephants - it will be intriguing to see how that works out.
Ghana might be considered the Germany of Africa - they always seem to come good at tournaments. But the last of their four titles came in 1982 and they have suffered defeat in the final three times since then, including on penalties to Ivory Coast last time out. Can they go one better in Gabon?
Algeria boast Africa's hottest property in 2016, Mahrez, and his Leicester team-mate Slimani as well as Porto midfielder Yacine Brahimi. They were unbeaten in qualifying and have strength in depth in their squad. They will be confident in their chances of winning a second title.
Senegal qualified with a 100% record and if they can maintain that kind of form, and Mane clicks up front, they will surely have a good chance of being there at the finals stages of the tournament. Alongside Mane, they have big talent in the likes of Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate and Fenerbahce striker Moussa Sow.
Egypt also enjoyed a strong qualifying campaign and have the pedigree to perform when it matters most. Like Senegal, they will look to one player more than any other - Salah is charged with providing the inspiration to win matches.
However, it is notoriously difficult to predict Nations Cup winners - Zambia caused a huge upset to take the title in 2012, giants Nigeria are once again absent, Ghana's fifth title is proving elusive and the competition is getting tougher all the time.
As Ghana's Andre Ayew says: ""I think the Cup of Nations is becoming increasingly difficult to win because all the teams are getting stronger.""",The 31st edition of the Africa Cup of Nations will kick off at 16:00 GMT on Saturday when hosts Gabon take on debutants Guinea-Bissau.
66,"The Carroll family, from Newtownabbey, County Antrim, and the Hughes family from Belfast cannot get home because their Easyjet flights were cancelled.
They were offered replacement flights but the planes depart late next week.
Easyjet said the strike was outside its control and was ""doing everything possible to limit the inconvenience"".
Robert Carroll travelled to Spain 11-days ago for a family holiday with his wife and three children in Salou.
Their flight home from Barcelona to Belfast was cancelled on Wednesday afternoon,  on the first day of a two-day strike by air traffic controllers in France.
The dispute, over working conditions, led to several airlines cancelling hundreds of flights across Europe.
The couple, who are both due back at work in Northern Ireland, had not budgeted for an extra week in Spain.
Mr Carroll described a scene of delays and confusion when they got to their airport in Barcelona.
""After waiting in a queue for Easyjet for three hours, we were told we were going to a hotel, so we queued for a bus for another hour,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster.
After the family were bussed to the hotel, they said they had to queue at reception for an hour and a half before being told that there were no rooms left.
""They then sent us back to the terminal, who then sent us to another hotel, who told us they can only take us for two nights,"" Mr Carroll said.
""So we're here for two nights.  Then after that we have to make our way back to the terminal, at a cost of 60 euros (Â£44) to ourselves, to find out where we're going to stay for another couple of nights.""
Mr Carroll said he accepted that Easyjet had no control over the strike, but criticised the airline for ""sending us to places that don't have any rooms"".
He added that his wife has had to take unpaid leave from her job because of the unforeseen extension to their stay.
Although Easyjet is providing a replacement flight and free accommodation, the family are running low on money.
""If we had to go out and spend money it would have to come out of money to pay for other things  We have been in Salou for 11 days so our spending money is depleted,"" Mr Carroll said.
Brenda Hughes was trying to get home to Belfast after a week's holiday in Benidorm, Spain, with her elderly mother and teenage son.
She said they were told their flight home was cancelled shortly after they checked their bags in at Alicante airport on Wednesday night.
Ms Hughes described the situation in the airport as ""horrendous"".
She said they had to stand in a queue for six hours, waiting to speak to the two Easyjet staff members on the information desk.
The airline has offered the family a replacement flight home but no seats are available until next Thursday, 16 April.
Ms Hughes said it will mean her son will miss a week of school and she will have to take extra time off from her job as a GP receptionist in Belfast.
She added that her 76-year-old mother requires daily medication and does not have enough tablets to last another week in Spain.
Ms Hughes also criticised staff at the airport, saying passengers, including children and elderly people, were not offered as a much as ""a sip of water"" during the six-hour wait.
The family were bussed to a hotel at about 03:00 local time on Thursday.
Ms Hughes said they have no money left after their holiday and are concerned about the cost of food in their four-star hotel.
In a statement to the BBC, an Easyjet spokesperson said the airline ""worked hard to secure hotel rooms and transferred all passenger onto alternative flights free of charge"".
""Due to the high demand on these routes some upcoming flights may not be available, but our airport staff are currently looking at other rerouting options for passengers.""
""Although this is outside of our control, EasyJet would like to apologise to its customers for any inconvenience caused.""
Addressing the accommodation complaints, the airline said it has ""booked two nights for passengers at the moment as we do expect some will travel back on their own accord"".
""We will continue to review the situation and provide hotel rooms for passengers until the next flights are available.""",Two Northern Ireland families stranded in Spain due to the French air traffic controllers' strike have criticised how their airline handled the situation.

""I don't think the genuine fans of Sheffield Wednesday have Twitter,"" he told BBC Radio Sheffield.
""Usually the people who have social media use it to talk bad things and be negative.""
He continued: ""I have absolute confidence that 95% of the fans of Sheffield Wednesday do not think like this.
""I sometimes receive messages from people who are fans telling me not to listen to the moaners on social media.""
Carvalhal, who said the club is having one of the best seasons in its 150-year history, took over at Hillsborough in June 2015 and led them to the Championship play-off final last season, where they lost to Hull City.
Meanwhile, the Portuguese has backed striker Jordan Rhodes to rediscover his best form.
The on-loan Middlesbrough man has scored just once in six appearances for the Owls since joining on transfer deadline day and missed a penalty in Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Leeds United.
""He was not playing when he came here and now he has played six games in a row. He was completely exhausted on Saturday so we had to take him off,"" Carvalhal added.
""Now he has had time to breathe and train he will perform better than in previous games. There's no question he will do better for us.""",Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal does not think people who criticise the club on social media are actually fans of the team.
68,"The infected delegates were among hundreds who had gathered for the four day forum organised by the Ministry of Health at a Nairobi hotel on Tuesday.
They have been isolated in a city hospital, but health officials say the number of people infected may rise.
It is unclear how they caught the disease, which has led to five deaths in the past month.
Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholera.
Most of those infected will have no or mild symptoms but, in severe cases, the disease can kill within hours if left untreated.
In Yemen, a large cholera outbreak is fast approaching 300,000 cases, according to UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien. He described it as a ""man-made catastrophe"" caused by both sides of the country's ongoing civil war.
In a press release on 24 May, Kenya's Ministry of Health said there had been 146 cases across the country since the outbreak began.
Some of those infected had attended a wedding at an upmarket estate in Nairobi.
As a result, authorities put in place emergency measures to try and curb its spread.
An outbreak two years ago killed 65 people across Kenya.",Nearly 50 people have contracted cholera while attending a health conference in Kenya's capital.
69,"The federal guidelines came after a nurse was put in isolation in a tent in New Jersey, a decision condemned by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Meanwhile, Australia has been criticised for a West Africa visa ban.
The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected more than 10,000 people and killed almost 5,000.
People are not contagious until they develop Ebola symptoms and the UN Secretary-General's spokesman said ""returning health workers are exceptional people who are giving of themselves for humanity"".
""They should not be subjected to restrictions that are not based on science.""
Quarantine decisions in the US are made in each state, and the new guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were immediately rejected by the governor of New Jersey.
The CDC said it was ""concerned about some policies"" being put into place.
New Jersey is one of three states with a 21-day quarantine for all health workers who have had contact with Ebola patients.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie defended the mandatory isolation imposed on US nurse Kaci Hickox, who was quarantined when she returned home from Sierra Leone. He added: ""That's what we will continue to do.""
Ms Hickox, who had no symptoms, has now left hospital in New Jersey for her home in Maine, where health officials say she'll be quarantined for 21 days.
She said she was made to feel like a criminal when she arrived back in the US last Friday.
Separately, Australia, which has had several scares but no recorded case of Ebola, has been criticised by Amnesty International for taking a ""narrow approach"".
A spokesman told Reuters that the ban made no sense from a health perspective but ensured that vulnerable people were trapped in a crisis area.
The decisions in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere aren't about proper policy, says the Washington Post's Daniel W Drezner, they're about politics.
""Let's be clear - Cuomo and Christie acted in the interest of being perceived as 'doing something' highly visible even though those actions will not make anyone safer,"" he writes. ""It's the definition of security theatre.""
Moreover, given US political realities, it's theatre that will play itself out again and again in states across the country as long as new Ebola cases continue to appear.
US Ebola weakness: Politics is policy

The CDC's guidance for travellers and health workers returning from West Africa sets out four risk categories, and puts most healthcare workers returning from the epidemic-hit region as at ""some risk"" of infection.
CDC director Dr Tom Frieden said workers considered to be at high risk or some risk would be required to be ""actively"" monitored for symptoms for 21 days.
Those at highest risk are anyone who's had direct contact with an Ebola patient's body fluids.
Even if they have no symptoms, they should avoid commercial travel and large public events, Dr Frieden said, adding that voluntary quarantine was enough.
More than 10,000 people have contracted the Ebola virus, with 4,922 deaths, according to the World Health Organization's latest figures.
All but 27 of the cases have occurred inside Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
The virus spreads through close contact and health officials say stopping the spread of the disease in the areas hardest hit by the outbreak will prevent Ebola's spread to other countries.

70,"That's the view of a student in the Midlands, talking about his life as a young Asian now that the terror threat to the UK has been labelled ""severe.""
Home Secretary Theresa May announced new anti-terrorism measures this week which call on schools and colleges to lead the way in preventing radicalisation.
Newsbeat spent the day in a school to find out what that means for teachers and pupils.
Holly Hall Academy is in Dudley, an area viewed as a potential breeding ground for extremist views from both radical Islam and the far right.
The government says schools like this will now have to play a key part in spotting the early signs of radicalisation.
Teachers and students both have a role to play.
Graham Lloyd, the head of the academy, says he doesn't see this as staff and students spying on each other.
""Teachers are always going to be concerned about anything that impacts on a student.
""Happy students are going to be successful students. We've always looked at what is going on in personal lives - it's nothing new and nothing we should be worried about"".
The police have been working with a local theatre group to put on a play to teach the pupils to identify signs their friends could be becoming radicalised.
Prittesh, one of the students who saw the play, said it was an interesting way to illustrate the dangers of online radicalisation.
He said: ""I thought it showed all sides of the argument and that it [extremism] can't be tolerated.""
The 15-year-old was also worried people might generalise about Asians: ""Just because they are brown does not make them a terrorist"".
He added: ""I think the whole Muslim culture is being closely inspected, especially with the media showing bomb scares and events overseas. If one is like that everyone thinks they're all like that.""
He's also worried that social networks like Facebook and YouTube are being asked to spot users who may be looking for or posting extremist material.
Facebook has been coming in for criticism for apparently not passing on warning signs from one of the men who killed Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year.
In response, Facebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it.
Prittesh doesn't want every word he writes being monitored: ""Obviously it's for the good, but you can't be sure that it will be used for that.""
Another pupil, Pavanya, 15, welcomes it: ""If they control the extent of how much they are looking at your posts, I guess that should be good.""
Chief Inspector Dale Randle said: ""We want young people to know about the vulnerability of going online, the dangers of getting involved with extremism and the dangers of becoming radicalised.
""This play is just another way to get into schools and get young people [to be] aware of the issues.""

72,"Mrs May pledged to reduce the numbers claiming in Britain while taking in the ""most vulnerable"" refugees from conflict zones around the world.
She also said high migration made a ""cohesive society"" impossible.
Her speech was criticised by business groups, with the Institute of Directors attacking its ""irresponsible rhetoric"".
Net migration into the UK currently stands at a record high, reaching 330,000 in the year to March.
The home secretary told the Conservative Party conference Britain ""does not need"" net migration at current levels, saying the net economic effect was ""close to zero"" at best.
In other developments:
BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May's comments on immigration were ""extraordinarily tough"" and ""utterly uncompromising"".
Beforehand, Prime Minister David Cameron had said he agreed with what she was to say.
Addressing the party conference in Manchester, she said the main way of claiming asylum - by people already in the country - had failed, and rewarded ""wealthiest, the luckiest and the strongest"".
The UK would not adopt a common EU policy ""in a thousand years"" she said, promising a ""new British approach"", including tougher treatment for people who have travelled to the UK from other safe countries.
People who have ""spurned the chance to seek protection elsewhere"" will not have an automatic right to stay in the UK, she said.
Instead, priority will be given to ""helping the most vulnerable people in the world's most dangerous places"", she pledged.
The first ever ""annual asylum strategy"" will be published next year, along with a register of people and organisations able to accommodate refugees.
The overhaul also includes a new system of ""safe return reviews"" so asylum seekers can be returned home when their country is assessed as being safe, and the use of alternative ID documents to remove failed asylum seekers who do not have their own passports.
Mrs May also said refugees should not be ""conflated"" with economic migrants.
The ""desire for a better life is perfectly understandable"" she said, but ""there is a limit to the amount of immigration any country can and should take"".
Controls are needed, she said: ""Because when immigration is too high, when the pace of change is too fast, it's impossible to build a cohesive society. It's difficult for schools and hospitals and core infrastructure like housing and transport to cope.""
Wages are also forced down and some people ""forced out of work altogether"", she added: ""But even if we could manage all the consequences of mass immigration, Britain does not need net migration in the hundreds of thousands every year.""
Mrs May said immigrants could fill skills gaps, but said ""not every person coming to Britain right now is a skilled electrician, engineer or doctor"".
She said evidence showed that ""at best the net economic and fiscal effect of high immigration is close to zero"" and that there was ""no case, in the national interest, for immigration of the scale we have experienced over the last decade"".
The home secretary hit back at critics of her planned crackdown on student visas, saying ""too many"" students were not returning when their visas run out.
""So I don't care what the university lobbyists say: the rules must be enforced.
""Students, yes. Over-stayers, no. And the universities must make this happen.""

Institute of Directors director general Simon Walker said he was ""astonished"" by the home secretary's ""irresponsible rhetoric and pandering to anti-immigration sentiment"".
""It is yet another example of the home secretary turning away the world's best and brightest, putting internal party politics ahead of the country, and helping our competitor economies instead of our own,"" he said, adding that ""the myth of the job-stealing-immigrant is nonsense"".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, John Cridland, of the CBI, said the government was ending up penalising skilled workers who ""add hugely to the collective economic strength of the economy"".
Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said the asylum changes were ""thoroughly chilling"".
""The home secretary's idea that the few refugees who reach Britain's shores under their own steam are not in need of protection is fundamentally flawed,"" he said.
""Becoming a refugee is not solely the privilege of the poor or infirm.""
UKIP accused the Conservatives of ""meaningless targets and use PR bluster"", saying immigration could only be controlled by leaving the EU.
Ministers have admitted missing their target to reduce net migration below 100,000, blaming the scale of migration from within Europe.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said he agreed with Mrs May's comments on the subject, saying integrating new arrivals was ""more difficult if you have excessive levels of migration"".
The PM also said he was ""incredibly proud"" the UK had built one of the ""most successful multi-racial, multi-ethnic democracies anywhere in the world"".
But he said that for an ""integrated, successful society you have to make sure there are enough school places and that hospitals aren't overcrowded"".
According to the latest figures released in August, net migration of EU citizens was 183,000, up 53,000 from the year ending March 2014.
The number of those arriving from countries outside the EU was still larger, with net migration measured at 196,000, up 39,000 on a year earlier.",Home Secretary Theresa May has unveiled a reform of the UK's asylum rules during an uncompromising speech to the Conservative Party conference.

Thousands of fans flocked to his house in KwaZulu-Natal in 2012 believing he had been resurrected.
He was an award-winning ""Maskandi"" musician.
Three years after his death, Gcabashe returned to the singer's hometown, claiming he had been kidnapped by a witchdoctor who had cast a spell on him and held him in a cave with zombies.
His fingerprints proved he was not the singer, police said at the time.
Gcabashe, 32, was found guilty of rape, assault, kidnapping, attempted escape from lawful custody and impersonating Khumalo.

CQC inspectors identified concerns across a number of services, including:
Ellen Armistead, deputy chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said previous improvements had not been sustained, and there had been an overall decline in the quality of care and patient safety.
""For this reason, we have recommended that the trust should re-enter special measures,"" she said.
""In particular, we would like to see significant improvements to the quality and safety of patient care.""
Responding to the report, the trust said it was disappointed but fully accepted the the shortfalls identified.
Richard Sunley, its interim chief executive, said: ""We are sorry we have let down our patients, their families and carers by not meeting the quality standards they rightly expect.""
He vowed the trust would ""make changes with pace"".
Two weeks ago the trust was one of three placed in financial special measures in an attempt to help them meet their savings targets.",A hospital trust has become the first in the country to re-enter special measures after inspectors found patient safety and care had worsened.

More than 100 people are reported to have been killed in recent clashes between supporters of President Salva Kiir and vice-president Riek Machar.
A 2015 peace deal to end a 20-month civil war has failed to quell unrest.
James Gatdet Dak, a spokesman for Mr Machar, blamed Friday's violence on government troops.
""Our forces have been attacked at Jebel base. We hope it will not escalate,"" he told the AFP news agency.
The violence is the first since Friday, when a half-hour gun battle with heavy weapons and artillery killed more than 100 people. Some estimates put the death toll at about 150.
A South Sudanese journalist told the BBC that reporters counted at least 100 bodies, inside and outside the presidential palace's compound.
Friday's exchanges were apparently sparked by a shootout between Mr Kiir's and Mr Machar's bodyguards. The two men met at the presidential palace on Friday.

82,"The statement is made on a covert recording made by the BBC's Spotlight programme.
Mr Cushnahan, who had been an adviser to Nama, has consistently denied that he was due to receive money.
Nama is the Republic of Ireland's ""bad bank"".
It sold its entire Northern Ireland loan portfolio to the Cerberus investment fund in 2014.
Nama was established in 2009 in the aftermath of the Irish banking and property crisis.
It took effective control of a huge property loan book in Northern Ireland and formed a committee to advise on that part of its portfolio.
Mr Cushnahan, a former banker, was appointed to that committee by the DUP.
Unknown to Nama he began talking to a US investment fund, Pimco, who were interested in buying the entire Northern Ireland portfolio.
Prior to leaving his post at Nama, Mr Cushnahan attended meetings with Pimco as it prepared to mount a bid.
He was due to be paid £5m if the bid succeeded - but it collapsed when Nama learned of Mr Cushnahan's role.
Another company called Cerberus then bought the loan portfolio for more than £1bn.
Nama had received assurances that no one connected with Nama (which would include Mr Cushnahan) was to benefit from that deal.
However, in the recording, Mr Cushnahan discusses work he did with a Belfast solicitor Ian Coulter.
He said: ""You know when I was working on that Cerberus thing to get that thing out, he worked with me to get that. And basically all the work was done by me and him.""
He goes on to say his role was deliberately hidden because of Nama's objections.
Meanwhile, a developer whose loans were in Nama has told BBC Spotlight he has made allegations of corruption to the US financial regulator
In a statement given to the programme late on Sunday, John Miskelly said that over several years he had gathered extensive evidence and records of his business meetings which he claims implicates others in financial misconduct, insider trading, and other corrupt practices.
His statement said: ""I realised that, in view of the continual suppression of my complaints to financial institutions, that this would be the only way to expose their financial misconduct and their corrupt dealings.
""All payments made by me to any persons during this period are fully accounted for.
""I have also reported financial misconduct to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in relation to the Project Eagle sale.
""My complaint to the SEC relates to insider trading and the bribery of foreign officials. I have initiated the whistleblower procedures with the SEC.
""I have consistently truthfully raised what I consider to be criminality and financial misconduct with the relevant authorities.
""In view of the ongoing investigation of my criminal complaints and in the interest of integrity of the judicial process I do not thing it is appropriate for me to make any further public comment on these matters.""","The businessman, Frank Cushnahan, who has been at the centre of the £1bn Nama deal controversy, claimed last year that he was due to be paid a fixer fee in relation to the transaction."

84,"Nottingham Crown Court heard James Stone, 24, of Upper Parliament Street, admitted seven offences including sexual activity with a child.
Stone was filmed by a group called Letzgo Hunting after members posed as a schoolgirl during web chats.
But police said the footage played no part in the case and they acted after the victim's mother contacted them.
Letzgo Hunting said they became involved after the 15-year-old girl's mother came to them over grooming concerns.
Posing as a 14 year old, the group swapped messages with Stone in which he admitted engaging in sexual activity with the girl.
Members then confronted Stone at the pub where he worked.
Police said he admitted posing as a 16-year-old boy in an online chat room in a bid to contact the girl.
When the conversation moved to instant messaging, he took her to his flat where she was manipulated into performing sexual acts.
Stone pleaded guilty in court to meeting a child following sexual grooming, two counts of sexual assault with a child, one count of sexual activity with a child, two counts of possession of indecent photographs of a child and one count of possessing an extreme pornographic image.
The CPS said that as he admitted his guilt early in the proceedings, no evidence from Letzgo Hunting was presented in court.
Prosecuting, Tina Dempster told the court Stone had asked the girl for sexual photos of herself and when they met in March had led her to believe they would be going to a cinema or restaurant.
She added: ""They sat and watched films on his bed before he forced her to perform sexual acts on him.
""The girl said she was scared and too frightened to say too much.""
In interviews the teenager told police: ""He hadn't respected me or anything. I felt numb. I didn't know what to do. I was frightened. I just wanted my mum at the time.""
In mitigation, Adrian Langdale said Stone had ""suffered a trial by public jury in many ways"" after video footage of him from Letzgo Hunting was put online.
He added: ""Already his name has been made widely public.
""He has been pilloried from the beginning to the end and he has been incarcerated for his own protection because of threats from the group and other individuals.""
Sentencing him, Judge Joan Butler QC said Stone had taken advantage of a girl lacking in self-esteem and ""went about a campaign of grooming"".
""I accept you didn't force her and you didn't use any violence but that wasn't necessary because you had groomed her so well,"" she said.
""An organisation became involved and got in contact with you and pretended to be young girls. You were grooming them in the same way as you had groomed the complainant in this case.""
Speaking after sentencing, police cautioned against vigilante activity.
A spokesperson for Nottinghamshire Police said: ""We're seeing a worrying increase in those who think they can take the law into their own hands when it comes to these types of internet grooming cases.
""Posting videos online of alleged offenders not only risks the safety of that person and their family, but can also compromise any subsequent criminal proceedings.""
Det Insp Martin Hillier from Nottinghamshire Police, who led the case, said it was important for people to report offences such as Stone's to the police.
He added: ""James Stone not only preyed upon his young victim under the guise of a schoolboy, he did it in the family home and during school time, under the noses of the adults in her life, because James Stone was hiding in her mobile phone.
""He groomed and manipulated her into doing things she would never do, before luring her to his home and taking advantage of her in the very worst way.""
Letzgo Hunting previously denied any blame for the death of Gary Cleary, who was found hanged at his Leicestershire home on 13 May after the group gathered evidence he was a sex offender.
On Thursday, Letzgo Hunting put a statement on its Facebook page that it had ""suspended all hunting activity"" indefinitely.

He announced in December he would be leaving the Bundesliga side after three seasons in charge, during which he has already won two league titles, but has failed to lift the Champions League - twice getting knocked out at the semi-final stage.
""He has this attitude to football [as an art form],"" said Valenti. ""Not just to win, but to win in a distinctive way that entertains the public.""
""The style of football I see in England, I doubt he has that in mind I mean, the football is very different. For that reason, I think he will have to change the mindset of English football.
""I think he will be happy - he wouldn't be leaving if not. Right now in Germany, he is held in very high esteem.""
BBC Sport's David Ornstein and Patrick Nathanson travelled to Santpedor, an hour's drive from Barcelona, to speak to Valenti Guardiola at his family home.
The sleepy village, with its intimate squares and winding alleys, would be just like the plethora of other 'pueblos' that dot the Catalan countryside, were it not for the worldwide recognition bestowed upon its most famous son.

Guardiola's parents, Valenti and Dolors, still live in Santpedor and their pride in their son's achievements is evident in the photographs and mementos that decorate the neat family home, just around the corner from the 'Camp d'Esports Municipal Josep Guardiola', where the local team play.
Valenti, a sprightly and affable octogenarian, warmly welcomed us into the house last week, as we went in search of the real Pep Guardiola.
Josep 'Pep' Guardiola Sala joined Barcelona's famed La Masia academy at the age of 13 in 1984 and spent six years in the youth team before making his professional debut in 1990.
""Already from an early age he would always be heading out kicking a football about. There was a sure-fire way to make him happy at Christmas and that was to give him a football as a present.
""As a youngster he would constantly be there playing in the square next to the house where we used to live, always with a ball at his feet. Everywhere he went, he went with a football.
""Given how much we knew Pep loved football, and that Barcelona had always been his team since he was little, we were certainly very happy at the beginning.
""But when he used to call up, it was clear that he was missing his family and his mother used to cry, but only when she had hung up the phone. It was very painful to be apart, but at the same time we knew this had always been his dream in life.
""When I used to go and watch him for the under-14s and we'd head back home in the car together to wash his clothes over the weekend, after a defeat on that journey he would sit in absolute silence. From an early age football was something that consumed him.""
Guardiola became a fixture in the Barcelona midfield and had won four La Liga titles, one European Cup and one Copa del Rey, the Spanish domestic cup, by the time he was named captain by manager Louis van Gaal in 1997. By the time he left Barca in 2001, Guardiola had played 11 seasons for the side and won two further league titles and another Spanish Cup. He went on to play in Italy for Brescia and Roma and for Al-Ahli in Qatar before finishing his playing career at Sinaloa in Mexico.
""He has always been a leader. Even when he was playing with his contemporaries as a kid, he was the one orchestrating things, taking the lead. We didn't know where this instinct came from, with him being so young.
""I remember one time a team from a nearby town came to play against Santpedor. One player was missing to make a full 11-a-side game so they said 'Josep, why don't you come and make up the numbers?'
""He played and scored I don't know how many goals. So much so that the other team said as long as Josep is playing, there is no point in them turning up.
""He is a very good person - I don't say this because I am his father; many people would testify to this. The thing that happens is that in a footballing context his personality changes. He changes from the Pep that we know and love.
""He wants to win - to win and to play well. The game transforms him. I really don't understand where his fierce desire comes from. It certainly doesn't come from me, as I never played football. When I watched him on TV he reminded me of Michel Platini, the way he played.
""He was born for football. He liked everything - cinema, theatre - but he lived and lives for football.""
Guardiola returned to Barcelona in 2007, taking charge of the B team for one season and winning the Second Division title. He was appointed manager of the senior team in 2008, leading the club to three league titles, two European Cups and two Spanish Cups in his four seasons as boss. He took a year out before becoming boss of Bayern in 2013, leading the German side to two Bundesliga titles and one German Cup to date.
""It was something that we never thought would have happened. He came through the Barcelona youth teams and then the coaching system, so there were those who were familiar with how he worked, and so they said let's give him a go.
""I don't think they regretted it because he became Barca's most successful manager. We were very happy for him, because we knew how much satisfaction it gave him, to have been able to have put Barca where he put them.
""He went to New York [before starting the Bayern job] to disconnect a bit from the stress that came with being manager of Barcelona, and it was also for his children, so that they could learn English well.
""It hasn't gone to his head, he has stayed the same. It is on the pitch that he is transformed. There he doesn't have friends, he doesn't have anyone - he just wants to win. He wants the fans to enjoy his style of football.
""As soon as the referee blows his final whistle, Josep is an unassuming and very likeable guy. In a word, he is humble.""
In November 2001, while a player at Brescia, Guardiola was banned from playing for four months and received a £30,000 fine for failing two drugs tests.He continued to protest his innocence and was finally cleared of all charges in 2009.
""There have been times when he has been attacked from all sides. There have been journalists who have not liked him and when there was the whole doping saga in Italy he had to show great strength not to decide to quit the game but rather to continue because he was clean and he wanted to prove that. And that is what happened - he was cleared.
""There were times when he had a headache and his mother would say 'take an aspirin' and he would refuse, in case it affected his blood tests - and they say he was guilty of doping. That was very tough for him, but his response was to fight and fight - and that is the same approach he has with football. It is part of his nature, never to lower his guard.
""It is not like he has been given anything on a plate - when he first started at Barcelona he had to prove himself as there were those who had their doubts and told him to go back home. So he achieved it all through his own hard work.""
""They can expect to see someone with great humanity. They will be very happy because he has never disrespected anyone, he is very well-mannered and polite. To use a Catalan expression, 'he wont be taking anyone for a ride'.
""Winning, winning. That is what drove him. Winning but also playing football in a certain way, because at the clubs he was at his style changed the way the team played. Passing, passing, passing then at the right moment, bam, in the goal! None of the long-ball stuff. He never liked that.
""They can be sure that 24 hours a day he will be focused on football - on their next opponents, on tactics. For 24 hours a day he will be looking at ways to bring success to his team. I am certain about that.""","Pep Guardiola will ""change the mindset of English football"" as Manchester City manager, his father has told BBC Sport."

""As a result of that review, which examined a number of factors, including security issues, these men were unanimously approved for transfer by the six departments and agencies comprising the task force,"" a Pentagon statement said on Saturday.
The four Afghans - who had been held at Guantanamo Bay for more than 10 years - were flown to Afghanistan's capital Kabul aboard a US military plane and handed over to the local authorities.
The Pentagon provided no further details.
Afghanistan's High Peace Council - a body set up by the government to deal with insurgents - said all four would be reunited with their families in the ""near future"", according to the Associated Press news agency.
US lawyers for the former detainees had always argued that their clients were innocent.
Wells Dixon, who worked on the case of Shawali Khan for a number of years, told BBC World TV: ""They decided unanimously that he posed no threat to anyone.
""I am frankly surprised that he wasn't released many years ago.""
Mr Dixon added that he expected to see more transfers from Guantanamo Bay in the near future.
President Obama seeks to eventually shut the facility.
Earlier this month, six prisoners were flown to Uruguay, which said they would enjoy complete freedom in the South American nation.
About half of the remaining inmates at Guantanamo Bay have been cleared for transfer - but many cannot be repatriated because their countries of origin are considered unstable or unsafe.
President Obama's efforts to shut the facility have also been stalled in part due to a reluctance by Congress, the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from Washington reports.

90,"The multi-billion-dollar affair has already seen dozens of politicians and officials arrested.
Lula, with six others, is accused of hampering Operation Car Wash, the investigation into the scandal.
Lula, who governed Brazil from 2003 to 2011, has denied any wrongdoing.
The date for the trial has not yet been set.
Those also charged on Friday include former senator Delcidio Amaral and investment banker Andre Esteves.
They have been accused of trying to prevent former Petrobras director Nestor Cervero from testifying in a plea bargain deal.
Cervero was jailed for being the mastermind of the Petrobras scandal.
It is understood that the accusation against Lula is a result of a plea bargain testimony by Mr Amaral.
In May, Brazil's Attorney General Rodrigo Janot accused the former president of playing a key role in the Petrobras case, which is estimated to have cost the company more than $2bn (£1.5bn).
He said the corruption could not have taken place without Lula's participation.
Lula made a comeback to frontline Brazilian politics in March, when President Dilma Rousseff nominated him as her chief of staff.
But a judge then suspended his nomination saying it had been aimed at protecting him from possible prosecution.
Operation Car Wash was launched two years ago by prosecutors focusing initially on money laundering.
They say that their investigations have since uncovered a complex corruption scheme at Petrobras.
Prosecutors allege the scandal was used to finance the electoral campaigns of senior Brazilian politicians.
Several politicians and Petrobras executives have been arrested and sentenced.
Some of them have agreed to testify against other suspects in exchange for more lenient sentences, taking the investigation to a new level.","Former President of Brazil Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is to go on trial for obstruction of justice in a case related to the scandal at state oil firm Petrobras, court documents show."

Turkey's penal code makes it a crime to insult the president.

In it, he defends secularism and the principles of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish republic.
He also singled out President Erdogan for criticism over recent corruption allegations, as the crowd chanted ""everywhere is bribery, everywhere is corruption"".
Hurriyet newspaper said the boy was believed to be a member of a leftist organisation, but he denies having links with any political party.
Speaking to prosecutors, the boy said: ""I've made the statement in question. I have no intent to insult.""
The teenager has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers have lodged an appeal against the charges.
The arrest sparked fierce criticism of Mr Erdogan with Attila Kart, a member of opposition party CHP, saying the president was creating ""an environment of fear, oppression and threat"".
Mr Erdogan, who was elected president in August after serving as prime minister for 11 years, has faced several corruption allegations in recent years.
He insists they are baseless and part of a ""dark plot"" to oust him from power by influential cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is in self-imposed exile in the US.

But a section of the new constitution has been invoked instead under which the military retains significant power.
Critics have said Article 44 could lead to more draconian leadership and gives PM Prayuth Chan-Ocha unchecked power.
Security forces are still able to make arrests without warrants and detain people without charge, while Gen Prayuth - who led last year's coup - can rule by executive order in the name of national security.
The media remains heavily restricted and political gatherings of more than five people are still banned.

""We are concerned that moving to a security order under Article 44 will not accomplish any of these objectives,"" a State Department official said.
""We would welcome the actual, full restoration of civil liberties in Thailand.""
The move was also criticised as inadequate within Thailand.

The Thai military government - officially known as the National Council for Peace and Order - has promised to restore democracy and hold elections in late 2015, but there is concern it is consolidating its power before then.
Officials had said the civil restrictions were necessary to maintain stability after the political unrest that preceded the coup. But the government had come under increasing pressure both from rights groups and from the vital tourism sector to end martial law.
On Wednesday, Gen Prayuth insisted Article 44 would be ""exercised constructively"", telling Thais: ""Don't worry, if you're not doing anything wrong, there's no need to be afraid.""",The US says the replacement of martial law with new emergency measures in Thailand does little to restore democracy in the military-run country.

BOA chief Executive Andy Hunt added: ""Through her remarkable talent and tireless work ethic, Becky Adlington has set a standard of excellence that future generations of Team GB athletes will aspire to reach.
""She represents the very best of what British sport, and the Olympic movement, are all about.""
Adlington said in September that she would not compete at the Rio Olympics in 2016, feeling that as a 27-year-old she would be too old to be competitive.
In October, she undertook a 280-mile bike ride in Zambia with Olympic bronze medallist Jo Jackson, former Commonwealth champion Ross Davenport and ex-swimmer Mel Marshall to raise £50,000 for Sport in Action, a non-governmental organisation that looks to inspire change in impoverished communities through sport.
She says that her work outside the pool has taken on a greater significance, and that she no longer has the same motivation to compete at elite level.
""I had to look at things, take a break and see how I felt when I came back. It didn't feel the same getting back into training and it felt like time,"" she said.
""I hate the words 'retired' so I don't want to say it because I would never retire from swimming all together, but as an elite athlete I wont be competing any more and I won't be at the World Championships this year.""
In retirement, Adlington will head up the ""Rebecca Adlington Swim Stars"" programme to encourage youngsters to take up swimming.
""I want to launch my own learn to swim programme and I've always said that if I've inspired one kid to get in the pool then it would make my year and hopefully I can continue to do that,"" she said.
""As unpretentious as beans on toast, but with a cordon bleu talent, the retiring Becky Adlington has been a huge asset to British Swimming in her short career. Her expressed desire now is to carry on working in the sport, with the goal of getting every child in Britain into a pool and able to swim 25m by the time they leave primary education. Ambitious, but she has the clout and charisma to help make it happen.""
""I want to create a deeper legacy. I want all children when they leave school to be able to swim 25m - that's my ambition in life.""
According to research from the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) released last May, a third of children - 200,000 youngsters - in England cannot swim
The research suggested many had never had a school swimming lesson, despite its being part of the national curriculum for seven-to-11-year-olds to be taught to swim 25m unaided.
In December, Adlington criticised British Swimming's review into the team's under-performance at the London Games, telling the Times (subscription) she felt ""insulted, disheartened and saddened by the way they have ignored us, the swimmers.""
She believes that the appointment of her former coach Bill Furniss as the new head coach at British Swimming will improve the relationship between athletes and the governing body, and hopes to work with Furniss mentoring future elite swimmers.
""He knows enough about the sport and has been on so many teams that he's seen it all first-hand, so if there was anyone suitable for the role it is him,"" she said.
""Hopefully I'll still have a relationship with him where I can pass on my perspective as a swimmer.
""I'd love to stay involved in all sorts of ways. Hopefully I can help the younger guys coming up because I have been through it all.""",Great Britain's double Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington has retired.

The film-maker had earlier posted a new photo of Ben Affleck in the Batman cowl he will wear in the 2016 release.
Thousands of fans attended the annual celebration of comic books and fantasy.
They were treated to a string of film and television teasers, among them new trailers for the upcoming Mad Max and Hunger Games films.
Attendees were also shown footage from an eagerly awaited episode of Family Guy in which the animated Griffin family travel to Springfield and meet The Simpsons.
A host of celebrities were on hand to preview their wares, among them Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch and Pulp Fiction director Quentin Tarantino.
The latter used a panel appearance on Sunday to confirm he was pressing ahead with The Hateful Eight, the western project whose script was widely circulated earlier this year without his approval.
Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe was also in attendance to promote Horns, a dark fantasy about a young man who begins to grow a pair of horns.
While there, the 25-year-old revealed he had used a Spider-Man mask and costume in order to walk around the massive convention incognito.
The first image of Wonder Woman was shown at a panel event on Saturday which saw Affleck share the stage with Superman actor Henry Cavill.

98,"Elliott Johnson, who was found dead on railway tracks in Bedfordshire, claimed he was bullied by Tory supporters.
His parents fought for his inquest to be widened to look at the culture in the party.
But, coroner Tom Osborne said: ""I will not allow the inquest to be used as a tool for putting anyone on trial.""
A pre-inquest review heard Mr Johnson could have suffered ""inhuman or degrading"" treatment at the hands of party members.
Live updates from Beds, Bucks and Herts here
A letter he wrote, found after his death, was read to Ampthill Coroner's Court, near Milton Keynes, during the hearing on Wednesday.
The 21-year-old wrote: ""These past few weeks have been the most difficult of my life. I've failed in money, failed in life, failed in politics.""
Mr Johnson made a complaint about bullying weeks before he was found dead in Bedfordshire in September.
Former parliamentary candidate Mark Clarke, who is at the centre of the allegations, which he denies, has been expelled from the party.
The case subsequently led to the resignation of former party co-chairman Grant Shapps.
Mr Osborne said it was ""clearly a sad and tragic case"", but emphasised ""an inquest is not a trial"".
""The purpose is not to determine whether the allegations of bullying set out in the letters left by Mr Johnson were true and I will not allow the inquest to be used as a tool for putting anyone on trial,"" he said.
""The purpose of an inquest is not to identify individual fault on the part of those involved. In deed it is expressly not concerned with apportioning blame or determining questions of fault.""
The coroner added Mr Clarke will not be called as a witness at the inquest.
He said Mr Johnson has a history of self-harm and suicide attempts, but this appears to have had ""little or no bearing"" on his death.
""It is my view that it would clearly be going beyond the proper scope of this inquest to be calling members of the Conservative Party to inquire into what steps or measures they are taking to investigate the bullying allegations by a party member towards another party member,"" Mr Osborne said.
Mr Johnson's parents, who live in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, have decided not to participate in an internal review by the Conservative Party saying they fear it will be a whitewash.
In a statement released via lawyers, Ray Johnson said he was ""not sure why"" the coroner did not want to call Mr Clarke as a witness at his son's inquest.
However, he said he was pleased that Mr Osborne has said he will ""keep an open mind in relation to any further information.""","An inquest into the death of a young Conservative activist amid accusations of bullying will not be used as a trial, a coroner has ruled."

The DUP delegation included North Belfast assembly members William Humphrey and Nelson McCausland.
Christian Flautists Outside St Patrick's, by the late Belfast artist Joseph McWilliams, is being shown as part of the Royal Ulster Academy's annual exhibition.
After the meeting, NMNI said in a statement that it ""welcomed the opportunity to listen to their concerns and engage in dialogue"".
""We have taken steps to acknowledge that some have found the painting offensive and, last week, we placed a sign at the entrances to the gallery,"" it added.
The sign, situated at the entrance to the exhibition on the museum's fifth floor, reads: ""Visitors may find some images in this exhibition thought-provoking, controversial and potentially offensive.""
The DUP's William Humphrey said they had not reached ""a meeting of minds"" with the museum representatives during the meeting, but it was ""important that we set out clearly our strong concerns"".
He said the painting was based on an actual event, and he had been contacted by a constituent who was ""appalled that he and members of his family are being depicted in this painting as being members of the Ku Klux Klan"".

102,"Martin McGartland survived a shooting in Whitley Bay on Tyneside in 1999, and was given a new identity afterwards.
He is suing MI5 for breach of contract and negligence after the shooting.
The High Court judge said because of sensitive evidence in the case, ""closed material proceedings"" could be used in the interests of national security.
The ruling means Mr McGartland and his lawyers will not be able to hear parts of the case or to see ""sensitive material"".
Special advocates will be appointed to protect his interests.
The west Belfast man claims MI5 failed to provide care for post-traumatic stress disorder and access to disability benefits following the shooting, that left him unable to work.
His book about his experiences, 50 Dead Men Walking, was made into a film in 2008.
The judge said the case included a claim by Mr McGartland, together with his partner and carer Joanne Asher, that ""their protection was mishandled"".
Powers to hold secret hearings were introduced in July 2013 so that trials using Closed Material Proceedings (CMPs) can take place in civil courts without damaging national security.
Mr McGartland's lawyers have described such proceedings as ""a serious aberration from the tradition of open justice"".
They argued that his claim for damages for personal injury did not pose a risk to national security and would not expose any aspect of his undercover work as an IRA informer.
At a two-day hearing last month, government lawyers told the court that an assurance of ""secrecy forever"" lies at the heart of the relationship between the British Security Service and its agents.
The Home Secretary would ""neither... confirm nor deny"" (NCND) that he is a former agent.
His lawyers have complained that, because of this, there has been no response to Mr McGartland's specific allegations that the Security Service withdrew funding for medical treatment, was negligent in the changing of ""handlers"" and broke promises with regard to financial payments, the installation of a phone line and access to state benefits.
His legal team has argued that the NCND policy is unlawful as public statements naming Mr McGartland as an agent have already been made by official bodies including Crown authorities, the police, MPs and the Bloody Sunday Inquiry.
A barrister for the Home Secretary said in a written statement to the court: ""An assurance of 'secrecy forever' lies at the heart of the relationship between the Security Service and its agents.
""The strict maintenance of the NCND principle is one of the most important means by which the Security Service makes good that assurance.""
The judge said in his ruling that the ""most difficult issue to be resolved will be how to deal with the detail of the claimant's case against his claimed handlers"".
While in an ordinary claim for damages, disputes are resolved by a direct confrontation between the claimant and witnesses, the judge said if that was not possible, ""a decision will have to be made as to whether or not such an issue can be justly determined at all, and if so, how"".
He said the best way to deal with this was under the provision for closed material proceedings.",The Home Secretary has been granted the right by a judge to use secret court hearings to defend a damages claim brought by a former IRA informer.

It found that one in five asked for phone numbers or pictures.
""These are concerning results,"" said Adam Stevens, head of the ICO's intelligence hub.
The investigation looked at how websites were harvesting large amounts of personal information, with half sharing children's data with third parties.
The research, co-ordinated by the Global Privacy Enforcement Network, an international umbrella group for privacy regulators, found concerns with 41% of the websites examined.
There were 50 UK-based websites among those investigated.
The study has not identified the names of the websites and apps, but Mr Stevens said they would be contacted and action could be taken against them to enforce changes.
It found that more than two in three gathered names and email addresses, with this information being passed on to other websites.
Less than a third of the websites had ""effective control"" of the information collected from children, and less than a quarter encouraged parental involvement.
Only a minority of websites had an accessible way for families to delete information that had been submitted.
Mr Stevens said: ""These are concerning results. The attitude shown by a number of these websites and apps suggested little regard for how anyone's personal information should be handled, let alone that of children.
""Internationally, we saw some websites and apps gathering more information than we felt they needed, and sharing that data with third parties.
""The most common concern domestically was a lack of information being provided about how their information would be used.
""We saw generic privacy policies that simply weren't specific enough, and some without any information at all, which isn't good enough.
""We'll now be writing out to the sites and apps that caused us concern, making clear the changes we expect them to make.
""We wouldn't rule out enforcement action in this area if required.""","Websites and apps aimed at children are gathering unacceptable amounts of personal data, the Information Commissioner's Office has warned."

""This is probably the first time in history that this happens. It's a very awkward situation to talk about, to be honest.
""You never like to win, especially these big matches against big rivals, with the retirement, but that's the way it is.""
Djokovic only learned that Federer was withdrawing during the preceding doubles final, and the Serb paid tribute to Murray for stepping in as cover.
ATP executive chairman Chris Kermode said he called Murray at 14:00 GMT, and the Scot ""instantly"" agreed to travel to the O2 to play a set of singles, followed by doubles with John McEnroe, Tim Henman and Pat Cash.
The British number one, who suffered  a crushing 6-0 6-1 defeat by Federer on Thursday, was back on the centre court in front of 17,000 spectators by 18:00 GMT.

She denied committing any offence when she compared Muslims praying in the street to the Nazi occupation.
In the latest scandal on Wednesday, the vice president of her political group is alleged to have voted for himself as well as for Ms Le Pen at least eight times.

But Jeilan slowly clawed back Farah's healthy advantage and overtook the Briton as they entered the home straight to win in a time of 27 minutes 13.81 seconds, with Farah just 0.26secs behind.
Jeilan's fellow Ethiopian Imane Merga claimed the bronze but Kenenisa Bekele, winner of the last four 10,000m titles, dropped out with 10 laps still to go.
Three-time Olympic champion Bekele had been sidelined since January 2010 through injury and never looked likely to challenge for a medal.
Farah had said he would be battling his nerves but showed no signs of anxiety as he cruised into contention. The pace varied during the early stages but he made sure he kept in touch.
It appeared as though Farah had got his tactics spot on as he powered to the front in the closing stages, only for Jeilan to move ahead with 35 metres left.
It was a very deliberate strategy by Farah. He ran a 53-second last lap but had the legs run off him. He will only look at his strategy retrospectively and wonder whether he got it right.
However Farah, who has made huge improvements since moving with his family to Oregon at the start of the year to be coached by Alberto Salazar, could not hide his disappointment
He became only the second British global medal winner over 5,000m following a bronze by Jack Buckner in 1987.
But Farah, who also won Britain's first medal at this year's World Championships, said: ""You give it 110% and it's not enough sometimes.
""I thought I'd got it right but it wasn't enough. I'll have a chat with my coach, analyse it and see what happened. It's nice to win a medal but I am disappointed with silver.""
And Farah denied he burst for home too early.
""I always wanted to go at 400, 500m,"" he insisted. ""That's my best tactics. I thought I had that speed at the end but he was finishing quicker.
That was a gutsy performance. He left nothing on the line, he did everything, he really did, he didn't quite get away from Jeilan and there was a slight opening of the door. That was agony to watch.
""I thought to myself if I could run 52 or 53 seconds (for the last lap) that would be enough. But it wasn't enough.""
""It means a lot winning a major medal. It would have been nicer with a gold but the better man won on the day and fair credit to him.
""I'll see how I go from here, hopefully see what I can do in the 5k.""
The heats of the 5,000m are on Thursday, with the final on Sunday.
Farah has been in superb form this season, stunning a top-class field to set a new British and European 10,000m record of 26 minutes 46.57 seconds at the Diamond League meeting in June.

111,"The base sits on the Brunt Ice Shelf, and is the sixth such UK facility to be erected at this location since 1957.
Together with Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula, it will spearhead UK science on the White Continent.
Halley gathers important weather and climate data, and it played a critical role in the research that identified the ozone ""hole"" in 1985.
In recent years, Halley has also become a major centre for studying solar activity and the impacts it can have on Earth.
This is most evident in the beautiful auroras that form over the base - the consequence of particles from the Sun crashing into air molecules high in the atmosphere.
Halley VI's researchers now have a state-of-the-art complex from which to monitor these phenomena.
Perhaps the most striking thing about the new station is its appearance.
""It looks like something in space,"" says architect Hugh Broughton.
The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) station comprises eight modules in all.  The seven blue ones are work and habitation units.  The central red module, which is on two storeys, is the social hub where residents can gather to relax.  It contains the dining room, the bar and even a gym.
The entire base stands on a hydraulic leg and ski system that allows it to be raised above the annual snowfall, and periodically to be towed closer to land.
If these adjustments were not to happen, the station would eventually be buried and carried to the ice edge where it would then be dropped into the ocean.
Halley bases I to IV were abandoned to this fate. The new design makes the adjustments easier and less labour intensive.
The station was constructed in large part in South Africa and then shipped to the Antarctic in easy-to-assemble units.
""The idea was to prefabricate as much as possible,"" explained Karl Tuplin, the project manager for the Halley VI building programme.
""Room pods, bedrooms, bathrooms - they were all made in advance.  Mechanical, electrical services - the wires and piping - came in cassettes that were just slotted into place.""
The hope is, some refurbishment notwithstanding, the new Halley can last 30-40 years before a wholly new structure is required.
""The feedback has been great,"" Mr Broughton told BBC News.  ""In the last station, not everyone had a window from their bedroom.  Now everyone's got a view.  The acoustics are better, and there're more opportunities to rest.  But also the working conditions are much better and there's a far greater array of different scientific experiments now possible at Halley VI compared to Halley V.""
The old station has just been dismantled and all its parts removed from the Antarctic.

112,"Public Health England is challenging businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020, and by 5% this year.
It says the food industry should try lowering sugar levels, reducing product size or pushing healthier products.
But experts question how the targets can be enforced.
Children are consuming three times more sugar every day than they should, which can lead to weight gain and obesity.
Currently, one in five children are overweight or obese when they start primary school and by the time they start secondary school that rises to one in three.
This increases their risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers in adulthood.
Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England (PHE), said children from deprived backgrounds were more likely to be affected by obesity.
""Tackling the amount of sugar we eat is not just a healthy thing to do, but an issue of inequality for many families.
""If businesses achieve these guidelines, 200,000 tonnes of sugar could be removed from the UK market per year by 2020.""
Kit Kat sugar content to be cut by 10%, says Nestle
Five foods surprisingly high in sugar
Brexit's bitter-sweet meaning for chocolate lovers
The guidelines apply to retailers and manufacturers as well as small cafes, coffee shops and fast food restaurants, which are thought to be responsible for an increasing level of calorie intake.
Food in nine different categories will have recommended sugar limits, including cakes, biscuits, chocolate and sweets, ice cream, puddings, yoghurts, breakfast goods and sweet spreads.
The sugar guidelines form part of the government's plan to curb childhood obesity, set out in August 2016.
Officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also been involved in producing the guidelines.
A sugar tax on the UK soft drinks industry has already been announced and will come into force next April.
PHE's sugar reduction programme is voluntary and it has no way of forcing the food industry to comply, but it said many companies had already taken steps to achieve the sugar targets.
It called the figures ""challenging but achievable, particularly in higher sugar products"".
Nestle, which makes Kitkat and Aero, recently said it had a found a way of reducing the sugar content of its chocolate bars by 10% without changing the taste.
Businesses are being encouraged to meet the sugar reduction guidelines using three approaches:
This means that some popular chocolate bars and tubes of sweets could shrink in size to meet the targets.
PHE said the guidelines were based on extensive talks with the food industry and public health bodies.
It said the success of its sugar reduction programme would be judged on measuring the net amount of sugar removed from the nine food categories, starting in March 2018.
Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar welcomed the sugar reduction targets and urged companies to meet them.
""We've seen over recent weeks that some companies within the food and drink industry have made great progress whilst others are seriously lagging behind and others claiming wrongly that they can't do it.
""Doing nothing is no longer an option - we need transparency from them about how they are meeting the targets with clear nutritional information made available for restaurants, catering companies and other out-of-home eateries.""
Sue Kellie, deputy chief executive of the British Dietetic Association, said people's behaviour needed to change as well.
""The government needs to further restrict the advertising of high fat, sugar and salt foods before the 9pm watershed and ban promotions on those same products.
""If we are to successfully tackle obesity and reduce its long term costs to the NHS and wider economy, we need to change attitudes and habits over the long term - there's no quick fix,"" she said.
Dr Amelia Lake, public health nutritionist from Durham University, said PHE was doing the right thing.
""This is an excellent approach using strong research evidence and we are being world leaders on the international stage in our sugar reduction programme.
""Not only are these foods commonly consumed by children - but also by the whole family.""","Sugar limits for everyday foods such as biscuits, chocolate bars and cereals have been published by public health officials in a bid to make UK children more healthy."
113,"Jermaine Baker, 28, from Tottenham, was killed in north London last December.
A legal bid by his family in the name of his four-year-old daughter to stop the officer - known as ""officer FE16"" - retiring failed and a High Court judge ruled he was free to leave.
Mr Baker's ""outraged"" mother vowed to continue her ""fight for justice"".
The 52-year-old officer is under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission but will retire at midnight and will not face disciplinary proceedings.
He is set to take up a new career as an adviser to a television production company.
Mr Baker and two other men were waiting in a car to try to free a prisoner who was being taken to Wood Green Crown Court.
Officer FE16 was not the officer who fired the fatal shot but was in charge of the tactical operation.
The legal action was launched in the name of Mr Baker's daughter  - known only as AB  - through her mother acting as her ""litigation friend"".
Lawyers had sought a court order to stop FE16 from retiring, giving them time to seek judicial review of the Met's decision not to suspend him from duty.
They said officer FE16 should be suspended from duty, which would have meant he would still have been liable to face disciplinary action.
The judge, Mr Justice Mitting, said there had been a prospect of the officer facing misconduct charges.
But he said the likely benefit to Mr Baker's family if those proceedings went ahead was ""not great"" and was outweighed by the ""serious interference"" they would cause to the officer's right ""to conduct his life as he wishes"".
The judge said the allegation against FE16 concerned a briefing which ""may not have given an entirely accurate picture"" about whether those in the car in which Mr Baker died were ""in possession of an actual firearm"".
The judge stressed there was no suggestion that FE16 was retiring to avoid disciplinary action, nor was there any possibility of him facing trial.
He had already given notice that he would retire in September after a 30-year career when he was told he was under investigation.
The Met firearms officer who fired the fatal shot is under criminal caution, with decisions pending on whether he will face a criminal trial.
Deborah Coles, director of the charity Inquest, said: ""We find the decision to allow a police officer to retire whilst under IPCC investigation into the fatal shooting a young man indefensible.
""This can only undermine family and public confidence in the investigation process. All police shootings must be subject to rigorous and exhaustive investigation and every individual police officer involved should be held accountable for their actions until the investigation conclude.""
Mr Baker's mother Margaret Smith said she was concerned that the IPCC had ""allowed this to happen"".
""I feel they have failed me and my family. This will not deter us - the fight for justice for Jermaine will go on,"" she said.","A senior officer involved in a Met operation in which a man was shot dead by police is being allowed to retire, despite being under investigation."
114,"They have used radiocarbon dating to place samples of burned wood in the middle of Columba's time there almost 1,500 years ago.
The charred remains of a hut were excavated in 1957, but it has taken until now for science to accurately date them.
The cell, or scriptorium, is where he worked, prayed and spent his last day.
The samples had been carefully stored at several universities - and latterly in a garage in Truro.
St Columba arrived on Iona from Ireland in the year 563. His Gaelic name is Colum Cille - ""the dove of the Church"".
He is widely credited as one of the key figures who brought Christianity to Scotland.
From his vision sprang Iona Abbey, which became a centre of literacy, learning and worship.
After his death Iona became a place of pilgrimage for kings and commoners. 60,000 of the latter still visit the rebuilt abbey every year.
But did Columba leave any physical trace?
His successor Adomnán, writing 100 years after the saint's death, described him working in his cell on a rocky hillock.
That knoll is called Tòrr an Aba - ""the mound of the abbot"".
Sixty years ago the site was excavated by a team led by the Cornish historian and archaeologist Charles Thomas.
It was early in a career in which he became the leading archaeologist of early Christianity in Britain and Ireland, with posts at Edinburgh and Leicester universities.
He eventually became the first professor of Cornish studies at Exeter University and a Bard of the Cornish Gorseth.
His dig in 1957 made an intriguing discovery.
On Tòrr an Aba the diggers found hazel charcoal, apparently the remains of a wattle hut.
The site had been deliberately covered with beach pebbles and there was a hole where a post - possibly a cross - had been placed.
Were these the remains of Columba's cell? Charles Thomas thought so.
If only they could be accurately dated. But in 1957 that was impossible.
The technique of radiocarbon dating was in its infancy then. It measures the level of carbon 14, a radioactive isotope, to assess the age of a sample of organic material.
But 60 years ago the process was expensive, required the destruction of a relatively large sample, and the dates it produced had a wide margin of error.
So Charles Thomas did not write up his findings in an academic paper. Instead he carefully preserved the samples from the dig along with his notes.
He took the remains with him from university to university. After he retired he stored them in his garage in Truro.
Which is where they sat until five years ago when a project led by University of Glasgow archaeologists Dr Ewan Campbell and Dr Adrián Maldonado heard of them.
Prof Thomas was happy to hand them over for testing using radiocarbon techniques of an accuracy unimaginable six decades ago.
The project, funded by Historic Environment Scotland and supported by the National Trust for Scotland, had the samples tested by the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre.
The result? The remains of the hazel stakes date the hut between the years 540 and 650. Columba died in 597.
Adrián Maldonado says it is ""within a standard deviation of the lifetime of St Columba"", which he says is ""about the closest you can get to being certain that it is something that was standing when Columba was on Iona"".
Historic Environment Scotland's Senior Archaeologist Richard Strachan is similarly enthusiastic.
He said: ""It's fantastic, it absolutely nails it. There's no debate. We can actually prove this scientifically. This is real. This actually happened here.""
Historic Environment Scotland are funding the project as part of Scotland's Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology 2017.
As well as re-opening some of the 60-year-old trenches to look for more dating material, Doctors Campbell and Maldonado are writing up Charles Thomas's personal archive.
Some of the early findings are being unveiled at the 8th International Insular Art Conference at the University of Glasgow.
Dr Campbell says it is extremely rare to be able to associate any archaeological deposits with a figure from the past.
He said: ""This being Columba, who is so important as a spiritual figure and as a person who founded this series of monasteries which cultivated that learning which spread throughout Europe, it's really important.
""It's really exciting to be able to touch some of the things that were associated with him.""
Sixty years on, some of Prof Thomas's fellow diggers on Iona are still alive.
They were as sure as they could be that this was the saint's scriptorium, but lacked the backing of modern radiocarbon dating.
Sadly Charles Thomas did not live to see his work vindicated. He died last year before the definitive date of his samples could be established.
But Dr Maldonado is in no doubt about the significance of his legacy: ""What Charles Thomas and his team found - and couldn't prove until now - was that we've been walking on the early monastery this whole time.""",Archaeologists say they have identified the remains of the cell of St Columba on the Scottish island of Iona.

117,"They have until 23:00 GMT on Monday to sign up or ship out players they will count on between then and May - so who will be the big targets and will the deals go through?
IN THE FRAME? Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur
WHY? Newcastle - who have made a £21m bid - are desperate to add firepower in an attempt to push themselves up the table and, for all his fragile relationship with West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace since a move to Spurs fell down in August, Berahino brings goals.
Spurs' need is not so desperate but history suggests he is a player manager Mauricio Pochettino rates as potential support for Harry Kane, who Berahino has partnered for England U21s.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? £25m.
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? He is a young player with pace and an ability to become a regular goalscorer - important assets for any team. He scored 14 league goals for the Baggies last season and was central to their survival and has 22 goals in 88 Premier League games in all.
At Newcastle he would become a focal point alongside 21-year-old Aleksandar Mitrovic. At Spurs he would lend valuable support to Kane but also provide a danger with his ability to drop deep.
WILL IT HAPPEN? May go down to the wire and no-one should expect the tough negotiator Peace to offer any bargains to potential suitors - August demonstrated he will not be railroaded into doing business. Newcastle could also find Peace unwilling to do a deal that would considerably strengthen a close rival. And of course Spurs love a late deal.
IN THE FRAME? Liverpool, Chelsea
WHY? A late developer, the 26-year-old Brazilian has scored 22 goals in 15 league games and four in 10 Champions League games for Ukrainian side Shakhtar this season, attracting attention from major clubs elsewhere in Europe.
Liverpool have scored just 30 goals in 23 Premier League games this season and with Daniel Sturridge more or less a permanent spectator and doubts about whether £32.5m summer signing Christian Benteke fits manager Jurgen Klopp's high-intensity pressing style, their situation has become urgent.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? Shakhtar say Teixeira has a £53.2m buyout clause in his contract - higher than an original £38m valuation. Liverpool have so far only offered £24m with £3m in add-ons according to Shakhtar chief executive Sergei Palkin - hence no deal so far.
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Teixeira will fit the Klopp template, mobile and busy as part of an attacking spearhead with the likes of fellow Brazilian Roberto Firmino. Would be a big statement of intent and he would have responsibility for solving the goalscoring gap caused by injuries to the likes of Sturridge, Divock Origi and Danny Ings.
WILL IT HAPPEN? Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre flew to Shakhtar's winter training camp in Florida to open negotiations and more hard talking needs to be done.
Teixeira is desperate for the move to go through and join compatriots Philippe Coutinho, Lucas and Firmino in Liverpool's senior ranks, saying: ""I want to be there but that is up to the club president now. I can only hope. I've played with Coutinho since we were 10 and it would be a lot of fun to play with him again.""
Whether he gets his wish depends on Liverpool increasing their offer and Shakhtar meeting them somewhere in the middle - but time is against this one.
IN THE FRAME? Leicester City, Newcastle United
WHY? Remy is a goalscorer of proven Premier League pedigree who is on the market because of lack of opportunities since his £10.5m move to Chelsea from Queen's Park Rangers in August 2014.
As demonstrated by their interest in Berahino, Newcastle manager Steve McClaren wants to add goal threat to his struggling side while Premier League leaders Leicester want to add quality from a position of strength.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? £11.5m.
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? At Leicester he would provide support and strength for the speed and mobility of Jamie Vardy and the creativity of Riyad Mahrez.
Remy would be the spearhead at Newcastle. He is fondly remembered on Tyneside after a successful loan spell from QPR in 2013-14, when he scored 14 goals in 27 appearances. He also has a very respectable overall Premier League record of 28 goals in 71 games.
WILL IT HAPPEN? There's a good chance he will leave Chelsea, who are ready to accept offers after the loan signing of Alexandre Pato. The price is reasonable by current standards and he would fit the bill for any side seeking goals.
IN THE FRAME? Everton
WHY? Everton's problems under Roberto Martinez have been in defence this season but with his attacking resources depleted by the £8.5m sale of Steven Naismith to Norwich City and the failure of Aiden McGeady to make an impact, buying a striker is also under consideration.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? £13.5m
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? A player with pace who has scored 12 times in 21 league games this season, Niasse would provide much-needed back-up for Romelu Lukaku, who has been carrying a heavy burden this season.
WILL IT HAPPEN? Everton have been looking to make a big signing during this transfer window and with Dynamo Kiev's Andriy Yarmolenko out of reach this looks like the one they will be pushing for on deadline day. Expensive for a player with no Premier League experience.
IN THE FRAME? Aston Villa, Sunderland
WHY? The 30-year-old France right-back has fallen down the pecking order and been troubled by injury during his time at Arsenal following a £10m move from Newcastle United in 2014. Debuchy has made only two Premier League appearances this season so it makes perfect sense for him to move on.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? Initial loan.
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Aston Villa manager Remi Garde is hoping to clinch a deal that will allow his fellow countryman to add experience at the highest level to a side currently looking certainties for relegation. Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce may be tempted into a late move but Garde will know the player and is currently in pole position.
WILL IT HAPPEN? There's a strong expectation Debuchy will go before the deadline, with Villa currently favourites.
IN THE FRAME? Everton, Arsenal, Stoke City
WHY? A player of proven quality who has been the talisman for Dynamo Kiev in their qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League, where they meet Manchester City. Now looks ready to finally cut his ties with Ukraine, where he is also a key figure for the national side with 22 goals in 55 games.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? £25m
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? A gifted, powerful all-purpose attacker. Wonderful left-foot and can operate on both wings and also as a number 10. Trademark has been to cut in from the right and score - as Everton found to their cost in last season's 5-2 thrashing in the Europe League in Kiev.
Everton boss Martinez has had the player in his sights since then and would use him in the number 10 role. If Arsenal pursue their interest you would imagine his versatility would be ideal there.
WILL IT HAPPEN? Don't see this unless something very dramatic happens - more likely to happen in the summer. Dynamo Kiev simply blocked Everton when they tried to do a deal in August - and it's hard to see why they would sell now with that Champions League meeting with Manchester City coming up.
IN THE FRAME? Swansea City
WHY? The pacy striker is not part of manager Alan Pardew's plans at Crystal Palace this season and has yet to score in the Premier League in the current campaign - but Gayle got 10 in 29 appearances last season and the 26-year-old might just benefit from a change of scenery.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? £7m
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Swansea have been forced to look at strikers because Bafetimbi Gomis' form has faded after a bright start and he would be an energetic partner for Andre Ayew.
WILL IT HAPPEN? There is a deal to be done there and if Swansea come up with a good offer then do not see Palace resisting too hard on this one.
IN THE FRAME? Newcastle United
WHY? Struggled to deliver this season with just five goals in 21 Premier League games and his potential partnership with Andre Ayew has not worked, although the latter has done well. Swansea may be tempted to cash in.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? £7m
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Newcastle United are looking to bring in a striker before the deadline to give them an added dimension - on his day Gomis is a powerful, formidable figure. Just that those days are getting fewer and fewer lately.
WILL IT HAPPEN? Newcastle are working through a list that also includes Saido Berahino, Loic Remy and Seydou Doumbia -  manager Steve McClaren is understood to want two strikers so Gomis could be a fall-back option.
IN THE FRAME? Manchester United
WHY? Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is short of defensive resources with the likes of Marco Rojo out injured and first-choice left-back Luke Shaw a long-term absentee as he recovers from a broken leg. Rose is not currently Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino's preferred option, with Ben Davies at left-back.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? £6m
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Will fit on the left side of United's defence, where Van Gaal is struggling for experienced personnel.
WILL IT HAPPEN? Long shot but United are desperate for full-backs. Spurs will not be keen on dealing with a direct rival in this instance but could just get a late deadline day phone call. United have reportedly watched Rose four times recently.
IN THE FRAME? Arsenal
WHY? The 19-year-old left-back has barely figured for Leicester but his performances in England's youth teams have marked him out as an almost certain future international.
HOW MUCH WILL HE COST? £5m
WHERE WILL HE FIT IN? One for the future. He has also been linked with Liverpool but Arsenal are trying to get in first for a player who could emerge as a threat to Nacho Monreal and England defender Kieran Gibbs.
WILL IT HAPPEN? Leicester want Chilwell to sign a new contract at the King Power Stadium and stay at a club on the up. Would take a special offer from Arsenal, or indeed anyone else, to persuade the Foxes otherwise.

118,"So who was right - them or the Labour leader?
Well, they both have a point.
There was a gap between what Labour was spending and what it was receiving in tax revenues in the few years before the great crash and recession of 2008.
But that gap was not massive: sometimes it was a tiny bit bigger than the growth rate of the economy, sometimes a bit smaller; which means there was no significant increase in the ratio of public sector debt to national income or GDP.
Thus in 2007-8, public spending was 40.2% of GDP, compared with tax revenues that were 37.5% of GDP: so the deficit was 2.7% of GDP.
Now there are plenty of economists and mainstream politicians who regard both public spending of that magnitude and a deficit of that scale as sustainable and indeed sensible.
And to put those figures into context, public spending by the government of Margaret Thatcher was significantly higher than that for her first seven years in office -  and she consistently ran a deficit of that scale till her last three years in office.
So it is quite hard to describe the fiscal conduct by the government of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as wildly irresponsible. And, to be clear, neither George Osborne or David Cameron were at the time shouting that the Labour government was maxing out the credit card and was about to bankrupt Britain.
But that is not to let Miliband or his predecessors off the hook.
The Question Time audience did not seem altogether satisfied with the mea culpa that Ed Miliband did make, namely that Labour's mistake was to put in place inadequate oversight of the banks to prevent them behaving recklessly and mullering the economy.
And the audience's unease may not be irrational.
Of course the crisis would have been less acute if the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England had taken earlier prophylactic action to prevent the banks lending and investing in their insane and greedy way.
But Labour wasn't just asleep at the wheel when it came to City regulation. Arguably it was drunk at the wheel - in that it loved the City boom, for generating huge tax revenues that it then lavished on public services.
So the failure to keep the City properly in check was in a sense wilful and therefore doubly wrong.
And there's another thing. Even best-in-class regulation of the City can't protect any economy from periodic shocks.
Which is why there is something to be said for George Osborne's favourite cliche, that it is sensible to mend the roof when the sun is shining.
Or to put it another way, when the economy is growing strongly, as it did through most of Labour's years in office, it probably does no harm to finance growth in public services largely through the proceeds of growth, rather than through borrowing.
Why? Well, the lower the national debt at the time recession bites, the more scope there is to borrow to protect public services and increase benefits, to shield people from the pain of recession.
The point is that since 2007-8, and as a direct result of the recession-induced collapse in tax revenues and surge in public spending on benefits, the national debt has doubled, from roughly 40% of GDP to 80% of GDP.
And the bleedin' obvious point is that if the national debt was today nearer 70% of GDP, almost the entire debate of this general election campaign wouldn't have to be about how much more austerity is needed and the timing of that austerity.
None of which is to say that the Tories are right to argue that the best thing for the economy at this juncture is to turn the deficit into a surplus as soon as possible: the Labour and Liberal Democrat case that a slower pace of welfare and departmental cuts would be fairer and better for our prosperity is supported by many economists.
What's more the debate remains lively (ahem) about whether the scale of cuts made by the current Tory and LibDem government in its early years was too great, and imposed too much hardship in the cause of regaining fiscal credibility.
But although Ed Miliband could plausibly argue that the Tories and LibDems forced more austerity on us than was necessary, it is not altogether surprising that his circumscribed admission of culpability for our economic woes causes a good deal of harrumphing.",Members of the Question Time audience became conspicuously grumpy when Ed Miliband said the last Labour government did not over-spend.

""We have never objected to the idea of West Ham playing at the stadium; the question is simply one of how much the club should pay, and how much the taxpayer should be expected to fund.""
West Ham, having won the right to be anchor tenants for the Olympic Stadium in 2013, played their first game there in August, after 112 years at Upton Park.
The Premier League club contributes £2.5m a year in rent, after paying a one-off £15m towards the conversion cost.
The Olympic Stadium Coalition, which is comprised of 14 supporters' trusts and groups, said taxpayers deserved to be made ""fully aware"" of how much they are paying.
It added: ""We hope to be able to meet the mayor to present him with the significant information that we have gathered about the operational costs of the stadium.
""The mayor's investigation is good new starting point, but it is only a start.""
The investigation is ""fully supported"" by Mayor of Newham Sir Robin Wales, whose borough co-owns the stadium after investing £40m.
And John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: ""For too long the details of this shabby deal were kept in secret and lacked proper scrutiny, so Sadiq Khan is absolutely right to look again at the case.
""It's now down to those in charge of the inquiry to get to the bottom of how West Ham were gifted the deal of the century while ensuring their investigation doesn't end up costing the taxpayer as much as the stadium.""
West Ham's move to the London Stadium has been marred by fan violence, leading the club to issue a five-point security plan to prevent further disorder.",Campaigners have welcomed the start of an investigation by London Mayor Sadiq Khan into a £50m rise in the cost of converting West Ham's London Stadium.
120,"Administrators have been appointed to run the newspaper. There is no explanation for the court's decision.
Zaman is closely linked to the Hizmet movement of influential US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former Erdogan ally.
Turkey describes Hizmet as a  ""terrorist organisation"" aiming to overthrow the government. Many of its supporters have been arrested.
Mr Erdogan's government has come under increasing international criticism over its treatment of journalists.
Press freedom 'a major concern'
In a statement, Zaman said the country was going through its ""darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press"".
It expressed ""deep concern"" at the latest court order - the culmination of pressure for more than two years on Turkey's ""highest circulating newspaper, Zaman, and its sister publication Today's Zaman"". It said the pressure had been through ""accreditation bans, tax inspections, meddling with its advertisers and threats to its readers"".
Editor-in-chief Sevgi Akarcesme told Reuters news agency this was ""the practical end of media freedom in Turkey"".
""The media has always been under pressure, but it has never been so blatant,"" she said.
Dozens of supporters gathered outside the paper's Istanbul headquarters after the announcement of the court decision.
One held a placard saying, ""We will fight for a free press.""
Amnesty International's Andrew Gardner said: ""By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogan's government is steamrolling over human rights.
""A free and independent media, together with the rule of law and independent judiciary, are the cornerstones of internationally guaranteed freedoms which are the right of everyone in Turkey,"" he said.
The move against Zaman comes days after Turkey's Constitutional Court ordered the release from detention of two Turkish journalists charged with revealing state secrets.
Can Dundar and Erdem Gul, from the newspaper Cumhuriyet, were detained in November over a report alleging that the Turkish government tried to ship arms to Islamists in Syria.
The pair still face possible life sentences at their trial on 25 March.
Two newspapers and two television channels were put under state administration last year over their alleged links with the Hizmet movement.
The Turkish government has accused Mr Gulen, Hizmet's spiritual leader, of trying to run a parallel state.
On Friday, state-run Anadolu news agency said police had detained four senior officials of a company linked to Mr Gulen in the central city of Kayseri.
Turkey has asked the US to extradite Mr Gulen. The exiled cleric has allies in the Turkish police and judiciary, media and financial  interests as well as a network of schools.

121,"The pair, a 27-year-old Algerian and a 22-year-old Nigerian, were arrested last month on suspicion of planning a terror attack in GÃ¶ttingen, where they lived with their parents.
Raids on their homes uncovered a gun and a flag belonging to the so-called Islamic State group.
Charges were never brought, but the Lower Saxony interior ministry classified them as a threat to national security and requested their expulsion.
""We are sending a clear warning to all fanatics nationwide that we will not give them a centimetre of space to carry out their despicable plans,"" said the regional Interior Minister Boris Pistorius.
""They will face the full force of the law regardless of whether they were born here or not.""
According to the ministry, this is the first time such a decision has been taken and opens up a debate around the rights of those who have committed a crime or, as in this case, are suspected of doing so, to remain in the country.
Germany, like many European states, subscribes to the idea of ""jus sanguinis"", where citizenship is determined by the nationalities of one or both parents but not by one's place of birth.
As such, being born in Germany provides no automatic right to remain in Germany.
However, since they had not been convicted of a crime, the Lower Saxony interior ministry had to argue that they nevertheless presented a security risk sufficient to expel them.
Rules on deportation are taken at a regional or state level.
In this case, the federal court was merely approving a request from the state's interior ministry.
The other consideration was whether deporting the men to their parents' country of origin presented a risk to their safety.
To date, there is no publicly available information on how either Algeria or Nigeria will deal with the men should the deportations go ahead.
A year ago, French President FranÃ§ois Hollande had to drop a move to strip convicted terrorists with dual nationality of their French passport and deport them, after an outcry in his own party.
Human rights groups argued that being able to take away French nationality from convicted terrorists would create two classes of French nationality and was thus in contravention of France's founding principle of equality.

The customers affected have a Premier Account with Lloyds, which comes with emergency home insurance.
The stolen device contained details of their names, addresses, account numbers and sort codes.
It is described as being the same size as an old-style video recorder, so is perfectly portable.
It was taken from a data room belonging to Royal Sun Alliance (RSA) insurance, which provided the home cover.
The theft only affects customers who opened their accounts between 2006 and 2012, and who subsequently made a claim on the insurance policy.
""We recognise this should never have happened and apologise to all customers who have been impacted,"" said a spokesperson for RSA.
However RSA said there was no evidence that it was stolen by fraudsters, and so far it is thought that no one has had their account compromised.
Nevertheless customers are being advised to take out identity protection, as an extra layer of security.
RSA said it would fully refund the Â£20 fee for two years cover.
Lloyds said RSA was the insurance cover provider for ""a small number"" of Premier Account holders, and said it had contacted all the customers affected.

Hodgson's side begin their campaign in France by playing Russia on 11 June, before meeting Wales on 16 June and Slovakia on 20 June.
Rashford, who signed a new four-year contract with Manchester United on Monday, only made his first-team debut on 25 February, but scored eight goals in 18 club games to earn an international call-up.
Sturridge, 26, missed England's last two friendly matches but did take part in a training session on Monday.
He also trained at Watford's training ground on Tuesday, along with Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, with all three considered fully fit.
Southampton full-back Ryan Bertrand, 26, is carrying an unspecified injury but even if he does not play against Portugal at Wembley, he is not regarded as a fitness concern for the tournament.
Drinkwater helped Leicester claim a shock Premier League title, while Townsend - included in the preliminary squad predominantly as cover - was a member of the Newcastle team relegated from the top flight.
The pair were told of their omissions by Hodgson on an individual basis in the manager's hotel room following training.
BBC Sport understands both took the news in a respectful, professional way and wished Hodgson and the team well.
The rest of the squad were informed of Hodgson's selections at a team meeting shortly afterwards.
Drinkwater and Townsend said goodbye to everyone involved before leaving the England camp and will not be on standby for the tournament.
Drinkwater said later he was ""disappointed"" not to make the final 23 but described the season as a ""huge positive"".
Former England winger Trevor Sinclair told BBC Radio 5 live: ""For me Drinkwater has had such a good season and played such a pivotal part in Leicester's success, he deserves to be in the squad.
""I think he's had an absolutely outstanding season. He's shown what he can do at international level. What he does on the pitch a lot of the time goes unnoticed. He works so unselfishly for the team, I think he may be a big miss for the England squad.
""Townsend will feel unlucky because he's had a great finish to the season, despite Newcastle getting relegated.
""What I will say is, at least he's getting looked at. While he was at Tottenham he wasn't even getting the opportunity because he wasn't playing.""
Hodgson initially named a 26-man squad after the final round of Premier League games, having intended to reveal his final selection on 12 May until injury concerns prompted a delay.
That was cut to 25 when Manchester City midfielder Fabian Delph was moved to the standby list after picking up an injury.
Hodgson's squad is the youngest to represent England at a European Championship, with an average age of 25.
Goalkeepers: Joe Hart (Manchester City), Fraser Forster (Southampton), Tom Heaton (Burnley).
Defenders: Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), John Stones (Everton), Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur), Nathaniel Clyne (Liverpool).
Midfielders: Dele Alli (Tottenham Hotspur), Ross Barkley (Everton), Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), James Milner (Liverpool), Raheem Sterling (Manchester City), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal).

126,"The app will show a selection of prioritised tweets, based on what it thinks users are ""most likely to care about"", ahead of the normal list of posts shown in reverse chronological order.
And a new First View feature will let marketers place a video ad high up in the feeds.
The announcements came ahead of the company's latest financial results.
They are designed to make users more engaged with the platform and appeal to advertisers.
But one expert said the extra prominence Twitter was giving to video ads might backfire.
""The reason why Facebook has been so successful of late is that it has been able to put sponsored posts and videos into people's feeds,"" commented Richard Holway, chairman of the TechMarketView consultancy.
""But Twitter is a different affair as people typically spend a much shorter time looking at each post, and putting intrusive videos at the top of their feeds, making it more cluttered, is going to upset a lot of people.""
Unlike normal ads on the platform - which algorithms target at specific users - a First View video will be shown to everyone within a region or country who uses Twitter over a 24-hour period.
That makes it a potentially more effective way to build mass awareness of a product over a short period of time.
But another company watcher also expressed doubts about the idea based on the examples Twitter had posted online.
""The whole point of in-feed ads is that they should seamlessly roll through and not interrupt your experience,"" said Sarah Vizard, Marketing Week's news editor.
""Brands will love [First View] as it sits across the top of the page and everyone will see it, but for the users themselves, they will think: 'It takes over most of the feed. I came here to see what the people I follow are posting and to find information, and to get to that I now have to clear the ad.'""
Twitter is due to post its full year's earnings after the US markets close.
The loss-making firm's shares are trading about 69% lower than where they were a year ago, partly because of concerns that its number of users is not growing fast enough.
Last month the Recode news site reported that the service had cut the number of ads being shown to some of its most active users as part of an effort to keep them engaged.
More recently, the hashtag #RIPTwitter began trending on the service after Buzzfeed reported that the platform planned to change the order tweets were presented in.
The firm has since clarified that a toggle switch in its app's settings will allow the new function to be turned on and off.
If left selected, the ""never miss important tweets"" setting will affect up to the first 60 tweets shown at the top of a timeline.
If the user pulls to refresh the feed, it will return to its normal reverse-chronological ordered state.
Twitter said that users would see an on-screen prompt to alert them to the feature the first time they encountered it.
""No matter how much time you spend on Twitter, you probably feel like you've missed important tweets from accounts you follow,"" it said.
""We hear this from people every day. As a content consumer, the new Home timeline feature will help you catch up on tweets you don't want to miss from the people and topics you care about.
""As a content creator, it means your followers are more likely to see and engage with your best tweets. We've already noticed that people who have used this new feature tend to retweet and tweet more.""

127,"But this is exactly what happened on a recent US domestic flight when a turkey was spotted sitting in a seat on the plane.
While it is still uncommon to see turkeys and other animals on planes, more people are turning to animals to help them cope with problems and stressful situations.
Known as therapy animals or emotional support animals (ESA), people learn how to deal with their mental health issues better with the presence of an animal.
The animals are normally prescribed by licenced mental health professionals to people who have emotional or psychiatric issues, according to the National Service Animal Registry based in the US.
On the social networking site, Reddit, there have been 1,700 comments to date on the photo posted by biggestlittlepickle of the turkey.
Some reactions on the site to the photo include:
""This is what I get for praying no babies on the flight..."", says one user.
""This is getting ridiculous"", says another.
Another poster comments: ""Honestly anyone who even has a turkey as a pet needs therapy.""
The turkey in question, called Easter, was travelling with its owner Jodie Smalley from Seattle, who was flying to Salt Lake City.
""Having Easter with me was a source of positive presence. She was someone to focus on if my emotions became too much,"" she said.
""The flight we went on was only an hour and a half long. During the flight she was quiet and well behaved. She had a diaper on from a site that specialises in bird diapers and it works really well!""
Jodie has recently been through a separation and bereavement and struggled mentally and emotionally but finds Easter a source of comfort.
""Easter was found by friends as a baby and brought into my life during an emotionally difficult time.
""Being in a toxic environment, she was something to care for and love. Spending a moment just hanging out with her quiet demeanour and giving her affection is a moment of peace and meditation.
""There have certainly been dark days and no matter what, Easter always made me smile and laugh.""
Although Jodie has received a mainly positive reaction to Easter, others have not been as lucky.
In June 2015, officials in Wisconsin changed the rules on therapy animals after a woman walked into a fast food restaurant with a baby kangaroo.
The woman claimed it was an ESA but officials said therapy animals can only include a dog or a miniature horse.
In November 2014, a woman was escorted off a US Airways flight when her ESA, a pot-bellied pig called Hobie, defecated and squealed before the plane took off.
It has been claimed people are abusing the laws in the US to take their pets on flights.
In an article for the New York Post, writer Charlotte Hays is cynical about the merits of ESAs:
""Taking pets where they're legitimately not wanted is an exercise in selfishness or exhibitionism.
""If you can't go without the pet, don't go.""
Can therapy animals genuinely serve as a means of managing mental health issues?
According to Jodie, her ESA has helped her through the most difficult time of her life.
""Easter is a pleasant distraction, a source of love and affection. In the last year and a half I lost hope, stability, a home, a marriage, a family of in-laws and my husband.
""It brings me joy to see the wonder she brings to others.
""One of the biggest draws in life is to inspire others and to me, Easter is an ambassador of inspiration.""",To board an aeroplane and find that one of your fellow passengers has feathers is not a usual occurrence.

It had been due to join multi-academy trust Aldridge Education from January.
However, Aldridge said this would no longer go ahead and it would not continue to sponsor the school.
London-based Aldridge Education previously said IPACA governors had voted to join the trust.
However, following discussions with the regional schools commissioner it said the move was ""no longer in the best interests of the children and IPACA"".
""We will therefore stand aside as the academy's lead sponsor to enable a decision to be reached on how the school is best supported going forward.""
Joss Hayes, IPACA's principal, said a multi-academy trust with more resources to deploy locally would better support staff ""to achieve improvement quickly and ensure a sustainable and stable future for the academy"".
She said the Aldridge Foundation had committed to continue supporting the school ""as part of an orderly transition process"".
Chairman John Tizard and vice-chairman Matt Longshaw of IPACA board of governors resigned last month, shortly before the BBC also learned the school had been issued with a government warning over its finances.

On the ISS he will conduct experiments.
He will also carry out  educational activities designed to get young people interested in science.

Tim Peake Live: latest updates and video from the launch
The Soyuz space capsule is due to dock with the space station at 17:23 GMT.
Helen Sharman became the first British citizen to travel to space when she visited the space station Mir in 1991. Her mission came about through a co-operative venture between the Soviet government and British business.
Ms Sharman told BBC News: ""Launch itself is a day that you want to get on with, because finally, you're getting to do what you've been trained to do for so long. I trained for 18 months, Tim Peake will have trained for six years by the time he flies.
""You're part of a great big machineâ€¦ by that stage, the team is so big - the doctors, the trainers - that you're not going to be able to go wrong.""
The crew are placed in quarantine for two weeks before launch to ensure they do not become ill in space.
They woke up at 02:00 GMT (08:00 local time) for breakfast and after a farewell ceremony, they left the cosmonaut hotel in Baikonur for medical tests.
After a break, they got into their white ""Sokol"" suits - which are worn during launch and re-entry - before saying final farewells to their families.
Then, at about 08:00 GMT (14:00 local time), the crew boarded a bus to the launch pad, where they rode the lift to the top of the Soyuz rocket.
Mr Peake and his colleagues will then be strapped into their seats so that they can prepare for launch.

Mr Peake is the first Briton to be employed as a professional astronaut by the European Space Agency (Esa).
German Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst, who was selected along with Mr Peake for the astronaut class of 2009, told BBC News: ""He's had 6,000 hours of training - a brutal amount over several years.
""He also went through preparation for launch earlier this year when he was on the back-up crew for another missionâ€¦ so he's now completely ready.""
Mr Gerst added: ""As an astronaut at this stage you're really relaxed. Mainly because your principal worry is that something will get in the way of launch; that you'll get ill or there'll be a technical problem.""
Richard Farrimond was one of four UK astronauts selected to launch satellites from Nasa's space shuttle in the 1980s, though the missions were cancelled after the Challenger disaster.

The mission might never have happened, however, had then-science minister David Willetts not successfully argued for an end to the UK government's longstanding opposition to human spaceflight. The change came about through negotiations in 2012 with officials from Esa.
Mr Willetts told BBC News that Mr Peake had been on the training programme, but - at that time - not part of the manned flight programme.

The killings were part of an escalating cycle of violence, culminating in a war between Israel and militants in Gaza.
Mohammad Abu Khdair's body was found in a forest in West Jerusalem on 2 July 2014, two days after the bodies of the Israeli teenagers abducted and murdered by Hamas militants that June were found.
In November, the Jerusalem District Court found that Ben David and the two youths had abducted the Palestinian at random as he stood on a road in East Jerusalem.
The youths then beat him unconscious in the back of a car being driven by Ben David, the judges said. One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.
The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.
The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.
Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: ""The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.""
But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.
The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",A court in Jerusalem has handed two young Israelis lengthy prison sentences for the murder of Palestinian teenager Mohammad Abu Khdair in 2014.
135,"Instead of chemicals and mechanical treatment, 60,000 plants sort out sewage from the village which has a population of 750.
The reed beds are spread across five ponds in a wetland the size of five football pitches.
During the 90 days it takes for the effluent to pass through, bacteria, ultraviolet light and the plants act on it.
When that is done, the run-off can be piped straight into a local river.
It is the first natural sewage treatment works developed by Northern Ireland Water.
They call it an integrated constructed wetland and it cost just over half the price of a traditional treatment works.
NI Water began looking for a solution after the existing treatment works at Stoneyford began to fail.
It had planned to build a replacement, but then it heard about a wetland alternative at Glaslough in County Monaghan.
The next challenge was to persuade people in Stoneyford that it could work.
""The local people were saying `what are you doing, you're going to put raw sewage onto the ground, we don't want that`, said NI Water's Dermott McCurdy.
""They were thinking about furry animals, flies, smells, and I could understand that.""
So NI Water bussed a delegation to County Monaghan to have a look for themselves.
Mr McCurdy said that on the way back, there was a change in their attitude.
The wetland cost Â£800,000 and began working fully this spring.
In a couple of years the reeds and other planting will have matured. It is already attracting birds and insects.
The plan is to open it as a community resource that can be used by the villagers.
One resident, Jonathan Seymour, said there was a ""mixed response"" at first.
""Most of us are taxpayers and actually when we look at it, we're getting value for money,"" he said.
""It's nice to think that the environmental option isn't the most costly option. In fact, it's probably the cheapest option here.""
It is one of several now being developed around Northern Ireland, including one with a 5,000-person capacity at Ballykelly, and a smaller one at Castle Archdale in County Fermanagh.","It is not an obvious place for an evening stroll, but then the sewage treatment works in Stoneyford, County Antrim, is not your average industrial facility."
136,"The pair claimed a surprise World Cup bronze in Rio on Sunday, a result which also sealed GB a place in the synchronised 10m event at the Games.
""There are only eight synchro teams at the Olympics and three will win medals,"" Daley told BBC Sport.
""The odds are good and that's exciting.""
Daley came fourth alongside now-retired diver Peter Waterfield in the 10m synchronised competition at London 2012, before claiming individual bronze.
The London-based diver says he is surprised by the progress he and Goodfellow have made in their short time together.
""If you'd have told me back when we did our first somersault together earlier in the year that we'd be winning a World Cup bronze and qualifying for the Olympics, then I'd probably have laughed at you,"" he said.
""We knew we could qualify, but weren't expecting too much and then when we arrived we thought, actually we're as world-class as any of them.""
British divers followed a record-breaking 2015 World Championships by securing 11 of the maximum 12 qualification places for Rio 2016 through this month's World Cup.
In addition to Daley and Goodfellow's bronze, Tonia Couch and Sarah Barrow finished third in their synchronised 10m platform event, while the male and female 3m springboard pairs finished just outside the podium places.
Daley believes that in Rio this summer the squad could improve on their best-ever Olympic achievement of one medal.
""This World Cup has definitely shown that British diving is the strongest it's ever been,"" he told BBC Sport.
""I think we can definitely win medals and it's really exciting because there's potential in every single event.
""It just shows that all the hard work is now starting to show and that's good not just for 2016 but for Toyko 2020 as well.""
The British divers will next head to China for the first leg of the World Series followed by further events in Dubai and Russia.
The European Aquatics Championships in London in May will form a vital part of their preparations for the Rio Olympics.
""Considering we've only done one competition together Dan [Goodfellow] and I can only grow and I think the Europeans will be a great event for us,"" said Daley.",Britain's Tom Daley believes he and Daniel Goodfellow have proved they can challenge for an Olympic medal despite only pairing up earlier this year.
137,"An engaged couple, Jung Hyun-seon and Kim Ki-Woong, and Park Ji-young, 22, were named ""martyrs""  on Monday.
More than 300 people died when the Sewol ferry went down on 16 April. Many were high school students.
The captain and other crew members have been criticised for abandoning ship while passengers were still on board.
The ferry, carrying 476 people, was sailing from Incheon to Jeju Island when it went down. Only 172 people were rescued, with many others trapped inside the ship as it sank.
Park Ji-young, reportedly the youngest crew member, gave her life jacket to a passenger. She died while struggling to make sure passengers on the upper floors of the ferry wore life jackets and found their way out.
""Park pushed shocked passengers toward the exit even when the water was up to her chest,"" a survivor told local media after being rescued.
Jung Hyun-seon and Kim Ki-Woong were  due to marry later this year, according to local media reports.
""They were together for four years,"" Mr Kim's mother told Yonhap news agency earlier. ""I only hope the two of them will be happy in a nice place... my heart is about to burst.""
Their designation as martyrs means they will be eligible to be buried in a national cemetery, and their families can receive financial compensation and medical assistance.
Also on Monday, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revoked the license of ferry owner Chonghaejin Marine Co, saying it had contributed to the disaster.
The ferry is believed to have been carrying more than three times the authorised amount of cargo.
The captain and 14 other surviving crew members have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and breaking maritime law.
The episode has been marked by allegations of cowardice, corruption and incompetence, BBC Asia analyst Michael Bristow reports.
But the South Korean government has now recognised that there were also at least three heroes on board the ship, he adds.",Three crew members who died saving passengers as a South Korean ferry sank last month have been honoured by the government.

139,"When he lost out to Conservative Craig Mackinlay by almost 3,000 votes, he did indeed announce his intention to quit as leader. But that decision was short-lived - the party refused his resignation - and he remains at the helm of the party he has transformed from a fringe group to a major force in British politics.
In 2001, it polled just 1.5% of the national vote and only one candidate kept his deposit. By Friday its share of the vote had risen to almost 13% - some 3.8 million votes - and while the party won only one seat, it came second or third in dozens of others.
Much of that success has been driven by media-friendly Mr Farage, a picture editor's dream when snapped grinning with pint or cigarette (sometimes both) in hand.
His ""man in the pub"" image and disdain for political correctness left him free to attack rivals for being mechanical and overly on-message. This inspired affection and respect among those who agreed with him on core messages about cutting immigration and leaving the European Union.
True to his image as an outspoken saloon bar philosopher, he got into plenty of fights.
During the general election campaign, it was over TV debate comments he made about migrants using the NHS for expensive HIV treatment. They drew an angry rebuke from Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, who told him: ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself.""
But despite widespread condemnation from opponents, reports quoted UKIP insiders saying the comments - dubbed ""shock and awful"" - were part of a carefully planned move to appeal to the party's base. One senior aide was quoted as saying his remarks would be welcomed by ""millions and millions"" of working-class voters.
So how did a stockbroker's son become a mouthpiece for the disaffected working class?
Nigel Paul Farage was born on 3 April 1964 in Kent. His alcoholic father, Guy Oscar Justus Farage, walked out on the family when Nigel was five.
Yet this seemed to do little to damage the youngster's conventional upper-middle-class upbringing. Nigel attended fee-paying Dulwich College, where he developed a love of cricket, rugby and political debate.
He decided at the age of 18 not to go to university, entering the City instead.
With his gregarious, laddish ways he proved popular among clients and fellow traders on the metals exchange. Mr Farage, who started work just before the ""big bang"" in the City, earned a more-than-comfortable living, but had another calling - politics.
Age: 51
Family: Married with two daughters to Kirsten Mehr. Two grown-up sons with ex-wife
Education: Did not attend university after leaving fee-paying Dulwich College at 18
Career: City commodities trader from 1982, starting at London Metals Exchange
Political timeline:
Pastimes: Shore fishing, WW1 battlefield tours, Dad's Army, cricket, red wine
Mr Farage joined the Conservatives but became disillusioned with the way the party was going under John Major. Like many on the Eurosceptic wing, he was furious when the prime minister signed the Maastricht Treaty, stipulating an ""ever-closer union"" between European nations.
Mr Farage decided to break away, becoming one of the founder members of the UK Independence Party, at that time known as the Anti-Federalist League.
In his early 20s, he had the first of several brushes with death, when he was run over by a car in Orpington, Kent, after a night in the pub. He sustained severe injuries and doctors feared he would lose a leg.  Grainne Hayes, his nurse, became his first wife.
He had two sons with Ms Hayes, both now grown up, and two daughters with his current wife, Kirsten Mehr, a German national he married in 1999.

Months after recovering from his road accident, Mr Farage was diagnosed with testicular cancer.
He made a full recovery, but he says the experience changed him, making him even more determined to make the most of life.
The young Farage might have had energy and enthusiasm to spare - but his early electoral forays with UKIP proved frustrating.
At the 1997 general election, it was overshadowed by the Referendum Party, backed by multimillionaire businessman Sir James Goldsmith.
But as the Referendum Party faded, UKIP started to take up some of its hardcore anti-EU support.
In 1999, it saw its first electoral breakthrough - thanks to the introduction of proportional representation for European elections, which made it easier for smaller parties to gain seats.
Mr Farage was one of three UKIP members voted in to the European Parliament, representing South East England.
The decision to take up seats in Brussels sparked one of many splits in the UKIP ranks - they were proving to be a rancorous bunch.
Mr Farage scored a publicity coup by recruiting former TV presenter and ex-Labour MP Robert Kilroy-Silk to be a candidate in the 2004 European elections, but the plan backfired when Mr Kilroy-Silk attempted to take over the party.
It was a turbulent time for UKIP but in that year's elections it had increased its number of MEPs to 12.
In 2006, Mr Farage was elected leader, replacing the less flamboyant Roger Knapman.
He was already a fierce critic of Conservative leader David Cameron, who earlier that year had described UKIP members as ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"".
Mr Farage told the press that ""nine out of 10"" Tories agreed with his party's views on Europe.
Asked if UKIP was declaring war on the Conservatives, he said: ""It is a war between UKIP and the entire political establishment.""
""We Tories look at him, with his pint and cigar and sense of humour, and instinctively recognise someone fundamentally indistinguishable from us,"" London Mayor Boris Johnson in 2013
""This man is not a cartoon character, he isn't Del Boy or Arthur Daley, he's a pound shop Enoch Powell and we're watching him,"" Russell Brand on Question Time in 2014

""He's very outspoken - even the people who don't share his message think that he's a great speaker and fun to listen to."" Timo Soini, of the eurosceptic True Finns party
At the 2009 European elections, with Mr Farage becoming a regular fixture on TV discussion programmes, UKIP got more votes than Labour and the Lib Dems, and increased its number of MEPs to 13.
But the party knew it could do little to bring about its goal of getting Britain out of the EU from Brussels and Strasbourg - and it had always performed poorly in UK domestic elections.
In an effort to change this, Mr Farage resigned as leader in 2009 to contest the Buckingham seat held by House of Commons Speaker John Bercow.
He gained widespread publicity in March 2010 - two months before the election - when he launched an attack in the European Parliament on the president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, accusing him of having ""the charisma of a damp rag"" and ""the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk"".
It raised Mr Farage's profile, going viral on the internet, but made little difference to his Westminster ambitions. He came third, behind Mr Bercow and an independent candidate.
Mr Farage's chosen successor as leader, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, was not suited to the cut-and-thrust of modern political debate and presentation, and UKIP polled just 3.1% nationally.
But there was a far greater personal disaster. On the day of the election an aeroplane carrying Mr Farage crashed after a UKIP-supporting banner became entangled in the tail fin.
He was dragged from the wreckage with serious injuries.
After recovering in hospital, he told the London Evening Standard the experience had changed him: ""I think it's made me more 'me' than I was before, to be honest. Even more fatalistic.
""Even more convinced it's not a dress rehearsal. Even more driven than I was before. And I am driven.""
Mr Farage decided he wanted to become leader again and was easily voted back after Lord Pearson resigned.
Europe, and particularly migration to the UK from EU countries, has been a growing political issue since the enlargement of 2004.
Mr Farage increased UKIP's focus on the immigration impact of EU membership, referring to Britain's ""open door"" causing congestion on the M4, a Romanian crime wave in London and a shortage of housing, healthcare, school places and jobs for young people.
It led to repeated accusations of racism, described by Mr Farage as ""grossly unfair"". His strategy had long been to distance the party from the far right - its constitution bans former BNP members from joining.
Rather, he aimed to be seen as tribune for the disenfranchised, not just the older, comfortably off middle classes alienated by rapid social change caused by mass immigration, but working-class voters left behind in the hunt for jobs and seemingly ignored by the increasingly professionalised ""political class"".
Despite facing vocal protests, including taking refuge from Scottish nationalists in one Edinburgh pub in 2013 and being chased by ""diversity"" activists from another in London in 2015, his efforts saw UKIP's influence increase.
After winning more than 140 English council seats at the 2013 local election - averaging 25% of the vote in the wards where it was standing - it gained 161 last year.
More significantly, the party won the UK's European election outright, gaining 27.5% of the vote. Its momentum then built when Tory defector Douglas Carswell forced a by-election to secure UKIP's first parliamentary seat, with colleague Mark Reckless following suit shortly afterwards.
While polls charted a steady decline in UKIP support through 2015, commentators noted an unusual lack of energy from its leader and questioned whether he was fit for the fight.
It prompted Mr Farage to reveal he'd been in ""a great deal of pain"" at the start of the campaign, having neglected a chronic back condition caused by his plane crash. Despite physiotherapy helping his energy levels return, he never made the impact some thought he might.
Comments ahead of polling day that UKIP was ""about a lot more than me"", and that he was ""a complete convert"" to proportional representation, hinted that he believed the game was up.
Despite gaining 13% of the vote at the general election, with nearly four million people casting a ballot for the party, they only managed to return one MP, Douglas Carswell, with Mark Reckless losing his seat.
Mr Farage failed in his bid to win South Thanet, which was retained by the Conservatives.
He announced his resignation as party leader on the morning after polling day, but left the door open for a possible return by saying he might stand in the leadership contest after he had had the summer off.
Then he surprised some in the party by announcing that he had changed his mind after being ""persuaded"" by ""overwhelming"" evidence from UKIP members that they wanted him to remain leader.
This triggered a civil war at the top of the party, with MEP Patrick O'Flynn saying in an article in the Times that Mr Farage had become a ""snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive"" man who is making UKIP look like an ""absolutist monarchy or a personality cult"" and others calling for a leadership contest.
Add to that a row between Mr Carswell and Mr Farage over whether the party should accept the £650,000 in public funds it is entitled to as an opposition party in the Commons and UKIP is starting to look like a party in crisis.
It is not the first time Mr Farage has faced claims from current and former party colleagues that he is too dictatorial.
Former MEP Godfrey Bloom, Mr Farage's former Brussels flatmate, who resigned the UKIP whip after a string of controversies, told BBC News he was not a ""team player"".
Mr Farage himself has often spoken about how the party needs to stop being a one-man band in the eyes of the public.
He has pushed other figures, such as deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and deputy leader Paul Nuttall, into the spotlight.
But for the millions who voted for UKIP in the general election, Nigel Farage is UKIP.
Few politicians have been more closely identified with the party they lead.
And with a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU on the horizon, that situation is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.","On the eve of polling day, UKIP leader Nigel Farage told interviewers he would be ""for the chop"" if he failed to get elected in the Kent seat of South Thanet."

He also pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to assaulting her friend Toni Schumacher and a taxi driver.
Zeisz, from Liverpool, was jailed for a total of 16 months, of which he has already spent four months on remand.
Prosecutor Frank Dillon said that Ms Baker and Zeisz had been in a volatile relationship for about two years but it had become on-off.
In the early hours of 3 October, she and her friend Toni Schumacher bumped into Zeisz, who had taken both alcohol and cocaine that night, in a Liverpool bar.
Miss Baker spoke to him ""to keep things civil"" and later left the bar with her friend, who rang for a taxi.
When the former X Factor contestant tried to get into the cab, Zeisz grabbed her around the waist and then by the head and hair, the court heard.
He threatened to ""knife"" the friends and punched Miss Schumacher when she tried to help her friend. He also grabbed hold of the taxi driver's lip and gums.
A car, apparently summoned by Zeisz, turned up and although Miss Baker shouted that she did want to go, she ""reluctantly"" got into it.

144,"Mr Farage led a flotilla of fishing boats up the Thames to urge Parliament take back control of British waters.
But his Brexit armada was greeted by a rival Remain fleet carrying Mr Geldof.
The rock star yelled that the UKIP leader was ""no fisherman's friend"".
Mr Farage accused Mr Geldof of ""mocking"" impoverished fishermen.
The UKIP leader's flotilla, organised by Fishing for Leave, left the Kent port of Ramsgate early on Friday and reached Westminster during Prime Minister's Questions at 12:30 BST.
A handful of dinghies and other vessels bearing In flags sought to ""intercept"" the Leave flotilla as it passed under Tower Bridge, with the vessel carrying former pop star Mr Geldof playing the song ""The In Crowd"" over loud speakers.
There were reports of brief, light-hearted skirmishes, including the exchange of hose fire and a police launch got involved to keep them apart on the Thames outside Parliament while Prime Minister's Questions took place inside.
Addressing Mr Farage over a PA system as his boat, the Sarpedon, pulled alongside the boat carrying the UKIP leader, Mr Geldof called Mr Farage a ""fraud"".
""Here are the facts about fishing. One, Britain makes more money than any other country in Europe from fishing. Two, Britain has the second largest quota for fish in Europe after Denmark. Three, Britain has the third largest landings. Four, you are no fisherman's friend.
""You were on the European Parliament Fishing Committee and you attended one out of 43 meetings.""
Mr Farage branded Mr Geldof counter protest ""just disgusting... disgraceful"" and said he wanted the UK to get back the rights to its own fish.
""We used to protest against the establishment, now the establishment protests against us,"" he said.
""What multi-millionaire Mr Geldof did was to show his absolute contempt for the men and women who have come here from right across the UK asking, demanding, to be listened to as their communities are destroyed by the commons fisheries policy.
""As a spectacle, I think it is pretty disgraceful. And then what he did was show the depth of his ignorance... We are only allowed to catch 20% by value of the fish that swim in what should be our territorial waters. He clearly does not understand that.""
A group of 30 Leave boats set off before first light, stopping at Southend and Gravesend to pick up passengers before mooring at the Pool of London at 11:00 BST, having passed underneath Tower Bridge.
Police vessels and the harbour master were in attendance as the rival vessels circled on the river outside the Houses of Parliament, where the final PMQs before the referendum was taking place.
The Port of London Authority said it had spoken to both sides about ""excessive noise"" and the risk of disturbance to other river users but that the episode had passed off without any safety issues.
Mr Farage rejected claims it was a publicity stunt, saying it was a ""full-throttled protest"" against what he claimed was the ""destruction"" of the UK's fishing industry by EU membership.
""There are now many harbours without a single commercial vessel...Compare and contrast all of this with Norway who control all fishing stocks up to two hundred miles within the North Sea and has a booming commercial and angling tourism industry.""
But Greenpeace said the problem lay not with the EU but the concentration of UK fishing quotas in the hands of a few large operators - some of which it said were part of the flotilla - and successive governments failure to address this.
""The root of the problem lies in London, not Brussels,"" said the campaign group's director John Sauven. ""The distribution of fishing rights within the UK's fleet is entirely the responsibility of the UK's fisheries minister.""
""Brexit cheerleaders like Nigel Farage are cynically exploiting the legitimate anger of many British fishermen for political gain.""
This view was echoed by Labour, which said being in the EU was good for British fishermen as it gave them access to Europe's fishing waters and their boats were able to land and sell their catch in any EU country.
""To protect fish stocks and the livelihoods that depend upon them, we need a European-wide collective approach,"" said shadow environment secretary Kerry McCarthy, calling for reform of rather than exit from the Common Fisheries Policy.
""We cannot risk a return to the bad old days where fish stocks were declining so fast that there were species on the verge of extinction.""

145,"With 125 miles of navigable waterways, 190 miles of footpaths, 8m visitors a year, it's worth more than half a billion pounds to the local economy,
But are the people who run it properly accountable for their actions?
It's a question which some of the 6,000 people who live within the Broads Authority area have been asking for a while and it's one that came up on several occasions during the election.
The Broads Authority is in charge of looking after the waterways and promoting tourism to the area. It also has a big say in planning matters.
But the people who run it are not elected, they are chosen to sit on the board by either local councils or the Environment Secretary.
Last year, in the Queen's Speech, the government announced plans to hold direct elections to the Broads Authority and all other national parks.
""The main benefits of the Bill would be to improve local accountability, without necessarily increasing numbers (and) address a local democratic deficit,"" declared the briefing note which accompanied the speech.
Now it's been revealed that the plans have been scrapped.
""The democratic element on the Broads Authority is represented by the fact that the majority of people serving on the board are elected,"" Defra minister Rory Stewart told MPs.
He added that deciding who sat on the board ""ensures that we have a broad range of people with both environmental and navigation interests"".
He was addressing a debate called by the MP for Broadland, Keith Simpson, who believes that a directly elected Broads Authority would be good for his constituents.
""If I were being harsh, which I am not, I might argue that the Broads Authority is a quango,"" he told the debate.
""Ultimately, those representatives are all nominated, and now is the time to consider how we could have a truly elected part - although not necessarily a truly elected whole - of the Broads Authority.""
The MP for North Norfolk, Norman Lamb, said he was appalled that the idea had been dropped.
""There was overwhelming support in the Broads, and certainly in my constituency, for the idea that the local community should have a say, through a directly elected person or preferably persons, on the board of the Broads Authority,"" he said.
""That has been the case in similar authorities in Scotland for some years, and the world has not caved in"".
Holding direct elections to the Broads Authority had thrown up a number of difficulties.
Who would be allowed to vote, for instance, given that many of those who work on the Broads live outside the area?
Would people stand as individuals or with the backing of a political party?  Mr Simpson believed those obstacles could be overcome.
He reflected afterwards that he was disappointed by the decision: ""I will make further enquiries about why an idea which we were so keen on last year has now been dropped.""
It may well have been dropped because it was a Liberal Democrat idea.
Government sources tell us that with several high profile Lib Dems having constituencies in or near National Parks, the party was very keen to get the measure into last year's Queen's Speech. Now that the Lib Dems have gone, so too have the plans.
The Broads Authority told us: ""Nine out of 21 members are elected councillors from all the constituent local authorities and a third are toll payers to ensure that the views of local people and boat owners are heard. They are joined by national Secretary of State appointees, which are posts open to everyone.
""We also consult locally on a wide range of issues and have a number of engagement mechanisms"".
The South Norfolk MP, Richard Bacon, told the debate that he didn't believe that this was the most important issue on the Broads. His constituents were more concerned about the threat to boating interests.
But it is clear that some people have felt strongly about this issue. Will they now let the matter rest or will they keep on campaigning for directly elected representatives?",The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads are one of the most important tourist attractions in the East.

148,"The group, which includes Peter Higgs, who predicted the existence of the Higgs boson particle, and geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, say losing EU funding would put UK research ""in jeopardy"".
""Inside the EU, Britain helps steer the biggest scientific powerhouse in the world"", the group claim.
Vote Leave said it was a ""myth"" that funding came from Brussels.
In a letter to the Daily Telegraph the group said science should be ""front and centre in the EU debate"" as it was a key driver in health, innovation and economic growth.
""The EU contains a critical mass of expertise, with more than one in five of the world's researchers moving freely within its boundaries.
""EU decisions about scientific policy, funding and regulatory frameworks affect science the world over, and are influenced by British scientists. On the inside, Britain has access to people and funding and wields global scientific influence, far greater than we have alone.""

The signatories also include Sir Martin Evans, the chancellor of Cardiff University who was awarded for his work into stem cells, and Sir Andre Geim who won a Nobel prize for groundbreaking work on graphene, a material expected to revolutionise manufacturing.
The letter comes as MPs urged ministers to draw up contingency plans to protect the UK's science sector in the event of a vote to leave the EU on 23 June.
The Commons Science and Technology Committee said the UK benefited ""significantly"" from access to EU research budgets and would have to seek other sources for funding if it was withdrawn.
It highlighted the ""cautionary example"" of Switzerland, which was denied access to science funding programmes when the EU imposed sanctions in response to a vote to curtail the freedom of movement.
Committee chairman Nicola Blackwood said: ""In light of this, the government must conduct a risk analysis of the impact that a vote to leave would have on science funding and international collaboration.""
The committee - which includes supporters of both Leave and Remain - did not come down on either side in the debate, noting that there were both benefits and costs to the UK science sector from EU membership.
It comes after Prof Stephen Hawking said Brexit would be a ""disaster for UK science"".
But a group of researchers arguing the case for an EU exit disagreed saying Britain would be no worse off on the outside.
Prof Angus Dalgleish from the University of London and a spokesman for ""Scientists For Britain"" said: ""We are standing up against what is a very large body of people who feel that if we leave the EU it will be a disaster for funding and collaboration - and we completely refute that,"" he said.
A poll of nearly 2,000 researchers living in the EU conducted by Nature in March found 83% were in favour of Britain staying in.
A spokesman for Vote Leave said: ""The biggest myth in this campaign is that money that funds our universities, our farmers comes from a magical money tree in Brussels.
""There is no such thing as EU money - it is all paid for by British taxpayers as part of the three hundred and fifty million pounds sent to Brussels every week.""
Meanwhile some of Britain's largest developers have also urged voters to back Remain.
House building companies and housing associations, including Barratt Developments and Wates Group, say a vote for Brexit would cause economic uncertainty and damage investment which would make the housing crisis worse.
""What any developer requires is confidence and continued support from their financial investors - and those investors need certainty over wider market conditions,"" the developers wrote in an open letter.
""Leaving the EU would also have an impact on the UK's housing supply chain companies, which employ millions of people across the UK. This could disrupt the production and import of the supplies needed for building such as bricks and blocks. This will further delay and add costs on Britain's house builders.""
The Vote Leave campaign said the scale of immigration from the EU was the cause of much of the pressure on the housing market.","Leaving the EU poses a ""key risk"" to British science, a group of 13 Nobel prize-winning scientists have warned."
149,"A few dog walkers strolled around while commuters stopped to buy their first coffee of the day.
But just a few metres away along Southampton Row it was a very different story.
A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a US citizen in her 60s was killed and five other people were injured in a knife attack.
Police tape cordoned off a wide section of road while a white and yellow forensics tent marked the point where the fatal stabbing took place.
As the tent blew in the strong morning breeze you could still see the bloodstained pavement underneath before police officers on guard ran to cover it up.
Rows of journalists stood behind cameras focused on the scene while holidaymakers staying in the nearby hotels came past asking what had happened.
Some had seen it for themselves.
Emma and Mark Pigdon, visiting the capital from County Durham, were on their way back from the theatre when they saw the incident unfolding.
Emma said: ""We just saw a woman lying on the street. She looked like she had a pattern on her clothes but it turned out to be blood.
""She was a really small lady, really slight, which made me think she was a teenager. We were shocked when we later heard she was in her 60s.""
The couple described seeing another injured man sat nearby with his top off and something like a bandage wrapped around his chest while another woman sat crying next to the injured lady's body.
Another couple described seeing a group of girls running to the scene.
""They were running toward the park railings and screaming. It was all so fast that we didn't really know what we were seeing.""
Philippa Bagley also saw the aftermath of the attack.
She was staying at the nearby Hotel President and was outside having a cigarette when she saw what she thought was the result of a road accident.
""It just looked like someone had collapsed or come off their bike. I thought it was maybe a motorcycle accident. It didn't look frantic at all but just lots of people standing around.""
The attack came on the day the Metropolitan Police announced more armed police are to be seen on patrol to reassure the public and deter potential attackers in response to terrorist incidents in continental Europe.
The force had said it was considering terrorism as ""one line of inquiry"" in the Russell Square incident but now say their investigation suggested the attack was ""triggered by mental health issues"".
Morning commuters described their shock that Russell Square - an area hit by the London 7/7 bombings - had again become a target.
Shyam Sanghani who runs Imperial News and Gifts right opposite the attack scene said: 'You don't expect it to happen. It's so sad.
""We had more armed police being announced yesterday and then this today - it's scary and it makes you think. We've been here a long time and to have two incidents is awful. This is our home.""
Bill Cole, who works nearby said: 'I hadn't heard about it until my bus got diverted this morning.
""It's a shock. I think Londoners were already a bit wary about something happening and things like this add to that worry.""
As the forensic tent was cleared away and the pavement scrubbed clean officers moved in to gather up the remnants of the emergency operation.

It said a search warrant was executed at 18:00 BST at a central London address and no arrests had been made.
Lord Sewel is to be granted a ""leave of absence"" from the House of Lords.
He has already quit as deputy speaker and chairman of the Lords privileges and conduct committee.
Lords officials referred the matter to the police.
The Met said the warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act was granted by Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Police with sniffer dogs and a battering ram were seen at a building in central London.
News of the criminal investigation came after Lord Sewel said he would not attend the Lords until the outcome of any investigation into his conduct, after which he would review his ""long-term position"".
During that time, he will not be able to claim any expenses or allowances.
There have been calls for him to be expelled or to quit the Lords.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said requesting a leave of absence was ""not a resignation, not a throwing in of the towel. It's an acceptance that it may not be possible for him to return to the red benches until the investigation is complete"".
Lord Sewel was appointed as a Labour peer in 1996 but has sat as a non-affiliated (independent) peer since taking up his standards role.
The original footage, released by the Sun on Sunday, appeared to show Lord Sewel snorting powder from a woman's breasts with a Â£5 note.
The Sun then published further photographs of the peer in Monday's newspaper, along with details of new footage in which he is said to make disparaging remarks about a number of other politicians.
What are the rules for Lords?
As the House of Lords is currently in recess, the leave of absence will take effect from 7 September, when peers return.
Under the rules, he will have to give three months' notice before returning.
""I wish to take leave of absence from the House as soon as it can be arranged,"" Lord Sewel said in a letter to the Lords authorities.
""I also wish to make clear that in doing so I have no intention of returning to the House in any way until the current investigations have been completed, when in the light of their outcome I will review my long-term position.
""I believe this is compatible with due process.""
Baroness D'Souza, the speaker of the House of Lords, has written to Lords Standards Commissioner Paul Kernaghan asking for an investigation.
He is expected to decide in the next 48 hours whether to look into the allegations.

152,"Blackwell needed an emergency procedure to reduce brain swelling following an unsanctioned sparring session.
The 26-year-old retired from boxing earlier this year after he had to be put into an induced coma following a defeat by Chris Eubank Jr.
Blackwell remains stable in hospital but is yet to regain consciousness.
The former British middleweight champion is no longer being sedated, but he had a section of his skull removed to ease swelling on his brain. His recovery time and prognosis remain unclear.
The BBBofC's initial investigation has found that Blackwell was involved in a gym sparring session with a licenced boxer on 22 November.
BBC Wales Sport understand he is a professional fighter rather than an amateur.
Blackwell complained of headaches after the sparring session and was taken to hospital where it was determined surgery was necessary.
BBBofC secretary Robert Smith told BBC Wales Sport: ""We are calling people we know were involved and we are calling people we believe were involved.
""We are looking at arranging a hearing that will happen early in January. It is a matter we are taking extremely seriously.
""We want to hear from Nick as well, health permitting.""
Smith said the board would not yet discuss possible sanctions against those involved, although promoter Frank Warren has called for them to have their licences revoked.
""We will wait and see what happens at the hearing, I don't want to speculate on possible punishment,"" Smith added.
Blackwell's former trainer Gary Lockett, who was unaware Blackwell was sparring, says he is facing a long road to recovery.
""This is not a quick process, we are looking at several months,"" he said.
Lockett has called on the people who let Blackwell spar to be banned from the sport.
""I can't believe the boxer he sparred with, and the coach or coaches involved, would ever allow Nick to spar when he's had a brain injury,"" Lockett told BBC Radio Wales.
""In due course, I hope they are dealt with by the British Boxing Board of Control in the correct manner.""","A hearing into the circumstances that led to Nick Blackwell undergoing brain surgery will be held in January, the British Boxing Board of Control says."

But Frank Bainimarama told delegates here that whether you lived in Miami or New York, you wouldn't be able to escape the rising seas.
Fiji will lead the next key UN climate talks later this year.
This normally low-profile May meeting of UN delegates has been overshadowed to an extent by the ongoing question of future US involvement in the Paris accord.
While not addressing Mr Trump or the US directly, Mr Bainimarama told the negotiators that he would bring his own experience as a Pacific islander to his role as head of the Conference of Parties.
""We who are most vulnerable must be heard, whether we come from the Pacific or other Small Island Developing States, other low-lying nations and states or threatened cities in the developed world like Miami, New York, Venice or Rotterdam,"" he told negotiators.
""But together we must speak out for the whole world - every global citizen - because no-one, no matter who they are or where they live, will ultimately escape the impact of climate change.""
Other members of the Fijian team hoped that the US would be able to stay in the climate ""family"", but that progress would be made with or without the Americans.
""We shouldn't give up because one of the family has decided it won't walk with us,"" said Ambassador Nazhat Shameem Khan, speaking at the conclusion of these talks.
""At this point in time the US has not made that decision, and we don't know what the decision is going to be and we hope very much that they will remain within the Paris agreement... but we will not stop our work even if the result is a negative one.""
The US sent a very small team to this meeting, reflecting the new administration's cooler approach to the issue.
However, the American delegates were praised for the positive role they played.
""I personally have met with the head of delegation a couple of times, he's a very experienced diplomat,"" said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa.
""He is very open in repeating 'our position is under review' but he is actively engaged and participating in the discussions and I think that his attitude has been appreciated.""
Certainly, it is hard to escape the sentiment here that the world is willing to move on without the US.
This was echoed in the scheduling of the first climate ministerial meeting between the EU, China and Canada. It is due to happen in Berlin next week. A ""major announcement"" from the EU on climate change is expected on 2 June.
The EU also announced an extra â‚¬800m to help poorer nations between now and 2020. Around half that money will be earmarked for climate action.

David Potts, 25, of Coity, had denied grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent and GBH.
Co-defendant Nathan White, 28, of Maesteg, had denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and common assault against another prisoner, Ryan Madden.
They were acquitted by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court following a two-week trial.
The incident took place on the prison's Phoenix Unit after Hastie-Davies, who suffered a fractured skull and bleeding to the brain in the incident, and two other inmates refused to come in from the exercise yard.
Mr Potts, 25, of Coity, Bridgend, and Mr White, 28, of Maesteg, were part of a team of nine prison officers in protective clothing who went on to the yard to take them back to their cells.
Mr White told police he struck Madden to try to get him to open his hands in case he had a concealed weapon, the court had heard.
Jurors were told about a ""catastrophic"" failure of management leading up to and during the yard clearance that increased the risk of injury for all involved.
HMP Parc prison officer James Bibby watched CCTV of the incident and wrote a report on it.
Darren Preston, defending Mr Potts, said there was always a risk of injury to prisoners or prison officers in an operation such as this, whether by action or accident, and Mr Bibby agreed.
Mr Preston said to him: ""I think your concern was that the failures that we have identified of management, whilst we can't say they caused anyone injury, they increased the risk.""
Mr Bibby said: ""Yes, they increased the risk for all involved.""
He said the briefing before a control and restraint operation was important and the one on that day did not include enough information.
Mr Preston said: ""Would you agree that what you found [in your review] was that there was a catastrophic lack of management?""
Mr Bibby replied: ""Like I have pointed out, procedures were not followed and that is correct.""
The court heard procedures not followed included a command centre not being set up and negotiators not being brought in to try to resolve the situation with the inmates.
Mr Bibby also said no written plan was compiled, no commanders were appointed to take charge of the action, only one of the required three nurses was present and two of the nine officers did not have the proper training.
He also criticised the fact that the control and restraint on Hastie-Davies was allowed to continue after his injury was noticed.",Two prison officers accused of injuring inmates by hitting them with their shields have been found not guilty.

""But we could have been much better. I am frustrated with a few things.""
Glasgow are away to Munster next Saturday afternoon and before then, despite inflicting on Leicester their heaviest European points loss, the players can expect Townsend to point out where they could have improved.
""We didn't execute some of our set-piece plays very well,"" the head coach told BBC Scotland.
""I thought our forward pack were outstanding and we put them under so much pressure, but we could have had a lot more reward for it.
""With the pressure we had in the scrum, I am disappointed we didn't come away with a try, and it took a bit of inspiration from our backs to get the momentum back in our favour.
""I am listening to myself being critical when it is such a great start but there are a few things to improve for next week.
""We gave away too many penalties in the first half. But when we managed to get the ball, our forwards were carrying really well, with [scrum-half] Henry Pyrgos putting them into the right areas.""
Townsend felt the performance did not match the heights of the 37-10 victory over Bath two years ago in the same competition.
However, he picked out one particular area that was to his satisfaction.
""I thought both half-backs played really well,"" he said.
""Finn [Russell] was outstanding, especially in the first half with some great kicking.
""He trained really well this week, is back full of confidence and both he and Henry realised where the space was.
""Some of Finn's passes, moving the ball wide when it was on, were excellent.""
Russell was the subject of a tip tackle by Matt Toomua, for which the Australia centre was shown a yellow card.
""It was a dangerous tackle,"" was Townsend's assessment.
""By the law, because he didn't land on his head, it wasn't a red card, but the only reason he didn't land on his head was because Finn put his arm out.
""It could have been a red, but it didn't affect the outcome. Finn got straight up and that was great to see.""
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill felt his team lost their way after a promising first 15 minutes.

Perth Sheriff Court heard how Mackenzie, or Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, had been drunk the night before the crash.
He then had more alcohol before getting behind the wheel of his work's van on 20 February last year.
Sheriff Gillian Wade told Mackenzie: ""You deliberately decided to consume a significant quantity of alcohol which impaired your ability to drive.

He had also pled guilty to two further knife attacks committed within a day of each other which left victims wounded.
Sentencing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Boyd of Duncansby said McKinlay's criminal record included many offences of violence.
He described the assault on Mr Brennan as an ""an unprovoked attack"" on a young man, out with his fiancÃ©e enjoying a good time, who was now reliant on pain killers and suffered nightmares.
Lord Boyd said: ""The best word to describe what you did to him is your own - that is 'despicable'.""
The murder bid victim was wearing a potato sack over his head with eye holes cut in it and a rope around his neck as part of a scarecrow costume.
As McKinlay approached, he grabbed the rope and pulled on it which shifted the sack so that Mr Brennan could not see.
McKinlay then punched him on the head but the victim managed to break free and ran into the road and pulled off the sack.
McKinlay pursued him and punched him again before putting him a headlock and began stabbing him.
Others became involved in the disturbance and witnesses called the emergency services.
One of McKinlay's earlier knife attacks was racially aggravated. He assaulted Safdar Ali, then 29, at St Enoch's Square, in Glasgow, in December 2014.
The victim sustained a mouth wound which needed eight stitches.
The following day McKinlay attacked a bus passenger in the city's Dumbarton Road.
He struck Richard McCluskey, then 32, with a craft knife, which left him bleeding from his ear and left side of his face.
Defence counsel Niall McCluskey told the court that McKinlay did feel remorse for his crimes.
He said: ""He appreciates his actions have been to the significant detriment of others.""",A man who attempted to murder a partygoer dressed as a scarecrow in an unprovoked knife attack has been jailed for life.
163,"A £75m deal was agreed last week for the Liverpool striker.
The La Liga runners-up are not able to present Suarez to their fans as the Uruguayan, 27, is serving a four-month ban from football-related activity for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup.
""He is 100% a member of the club,"" Barca director of sport Andoni Zubizarreta told a news conference.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The striker will be ineligible to play for the La Liga runners-up or even to train with his team-mates until late October, unless the appeal lodged with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) is successful.
Zubizarreta believes the former Ajax forward will be a ""positive"" acquisition.
""We accept people here, imperfections and all,"" he said. ""I am sure Luis Suarez will be someone positive for us in the future.""
Suarez's ban was the biggest in World Cup history, eclipsing the eight-game suspension given to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for elbowing Spain's Luis Enrique - now Barca boss - in 1994.
""That Luis Suarez will not have been able to train for four months does not alter our plans because we always knew it,"" Enrique said at a news conference.
""It's bad that he's not with us from the start, but it's not a tragedy. Someone else will play.
""Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi, Neymar - coaches want to have the best players and the more, the better.""
Suarez, last season's Premier League top-scorer, signed for Liverpool from Ajax in January 2011 for £22.7m and had four years left on his contract at Anfield.
When he is eventually eligible to play again, Suarez is expected to wear the number nine shirt in a forward line that includes both Argentine Messi and Brazilian Neymar.

The club is looking to rebuild under Enrique, who was appointed in May, after failing to win a major trophy last season for the first time in six years.
If the transfer fee is confirmed at £75m, it will be the third largest in football history.
Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo cost Real Madrid £86m and £80m respectively.
Barcelona have been told by football's world governing body Fifa that, under the terms of the ban, they will not be able to publicly unveil Suarez, as they have done with previous signings.
It was estimated that about 90,000 fans were in the Nou Camp for Neymar's presentation in June 2013.
Meanwhile, Barcelona have allowed 22-year-old forward Cristian Tello to join Portuguese side Porto on a two-year loan deal.
Porto have the option to buy the Spain international at the end of the loan spell, while Barcelona can recall him after one season.","Luis Suarez is now ""100%"" a Barcelona player, the Spanish club has said."
164,"Hourly output fell 0.5% in the first three months of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
At the end of 2016, productivity returned to the level seen before the downturn, overturning years of decline which has weighed on wages.
But it has now slipped back again and is 0.4% below the peak recorded at the end of 2007, according to the ONS.
Economists have warned that the UK's productivity continues to lag behind its major trading partners such as the US, France and Germany.
ONS head of productivity Philip Wales said: ""UK labour productivity growth has struggled since the 2008 economic downturn, and the fall in the first quarter of 2017 brings to an end a recent run of quarters of positive growth.""
It was the first quarterly fall in productivity since the end of 2015, according to the ONS.
Today's productivity figures are bad to the point of shocking.
A fall of 0.5% in the first three months of the year takes the UK economy's ability to create wealth back below the level of 2007.
If an economy cannot create wealth efficiently, then the debates about government spending, public sector pay and austerity become all the harder.
If an economy cannot create wealth, then tax receipts - the mainstay of government income - weaken.

The UK has seen a steady economic recovery since the financial crisis, but it has been helped by longer hours and more people working.
Productivity has failed to grow consistently, raising concerns for businesses and policymakers.
Mike Cherry, president of the Federation for Small Businesses, said: ""Productivity is being stifled by chronic underinvestment, exacerbated by current unprecedented uncertainty and reflected in sluggish wage growth.""
The figures should also act as a ""very sharp reminder"" that Brexit is not the only challenge facing the UK, according to Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.
He said: ""Unless more is done to tackle the nation's low productivity, people's wages and living standards will continue to fall and the UK will be ill-equipped to compete once we do leave the EU.""
However, other economists said productivity - which is output divided by hours spent producing it - has partly fallen because there are record numbers of people in work.
""We shouldn't forget that the decline in productivity is the flipside of what we could call the remarkable success of the UK labour market,"" Dr Thijs van Rens, professor of economics at Warwick University, told the BBC.
The ONS said its figures also indicated ""striking"" differences between the City of London and other parts of the UK.
In 2015, output per hour worked in London's financial and insurance industries was about seven times higher than in the lowest productivity regional industries, it said.","The productivity of UK workers has dropped back to pre-financial crisis levels, according to official figures."

166,"World Rugby has asked officials to be strict when it comes to tackles, charges, strikes or kicks that make contact above the shoulder line.
Sanctions up to and including red cards can be used.
""Our priority is player welfare,"" said World Rugby's match officials selection committee chairman Anthony Buchanan.
World Rugby said referees had been told ""to be especially vigilant in this area"".
Buchanan added: ""The laws of the game clearly state that the necks and heads of players are sacrosanct. When it comes to foul play, the game is cleaner now than ever before but referees must constantly be alert to head-high hits.
""By taking this strong approach, we are saying to players that tackling an opponent above the shoulder line will not go unpunished.""
In its instructions to match officials, the governing body has cited a number of examples of dangerous play to look out for.
Concussion is the most common injury suffered by rugby players and numerous studies have suggested the condition can cause lasting and serious effects.
English Rugby introduced an online concussion awareness module for all coaches, officials and players in 2015, while the Premiership  became the first league in the world to introduce an instant video review system for potential concussion injuries.
However, Northampton wing George North continued to play on for Wales against England after appearing to be knocked out in this year's Six Nations.

While any measures to protect player safety are to be welcomed, cracking down on high tackles will be easier said than done. Since turning professional 20 years ago, rugby union has become more and more about winning the ""battle of the gain-line"".
Therefore, simply tackling an opponent to ground is no longer the aim, rather a ""dominant"" tackle that sends the ball carrier backwards. Therefore players are coached to hit above the waist, or to tackle in pairs - and the dangers associated with this are manifest.",Referees have been told to crack down on incidents which could lead to concussion in rugby union's autumn international series.
167,"The books, about Henry VIII's adviser Thomas Cromwell, are being adapted by Peter Straughan who co-wrote the 2011 film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow said the channel was ""very fortunate"" to have the rights to the two novels.
The six-part series is expected to be broadcast late next year.
Wolf Hall was propelled into the bestseller lists after winning the Booker Prize in 2009.
It tells the fictionalised account of Cromwell's rise and fall in the Tudor Court.
Its sequel Bring Up The Bodies, which focuses on Henry's second wife Anne Boleyn, has been longlisted for this year's prize.
The shortlist will be announced on 11 September.
Mantel revealed in November she had plans for a third instalment, to be called The Mirror and the Light.

168,"The woman's bones, including a skull and teeth, were discovered at Achavanich in Caithness in 1987.
Unusually, she was buried in a pit dug into solid rock and her skull is an abnormal shape which some suggest was done deliberately using bindings.
Maya Hoole believes advances in technology could reveal more about the remains known as ""Ava"".
Since the discovery and archaeological dig almost 30 years ago, plans of the site that were drawn by local authority archaeologists have been lost. Ms Hoole believes Ava's story has become largely forgotten.
The archaeologist has set up a website dedicated to new research on the bones, a decorated beaker buried with the woman and the Middle Bronze Age burial site, which lies close to the A9 between Latheron and Thurso.
Tests already done on the remains suggest the woman was aged 18 to 22 when she died.
She was buried in an unmarked rock-cut pit rather than underneath a cairn or in a pit dug into soil, which are the most commonly discovered burial sites from the Bronze Age.
Ms Hoole said she was only aware of a handful of other pits dug into solid rock that have been found in Scotland.
She said: ""A lot of time and energy was invested in this burial.
""It just makes you wonder - why go to all that effort? What was so unique about the individual buried here to receive such special treatment?""
The decoration on the beaker found with Ava appears to be unique, the archaeologist said.
She said: ""I've looked far and wide for comparable examples, but there's nothing else out there quite like it, again making this burial significant.
""I have closely examined the beaker decoration and discovered that at least three different tools were used to create the design, likely meaning that the artist had a specially-made tool kit and was prepared and likely experienced.""
Ms Hoole added: ""Like many others, I'm sure, I find skeletal remains completely mesmerising.
""The evidence shows that this was a young female, aged between 18 and 22, but we have no evidence of cause of death.
Since she was discovered in the 1980s we have made great advances in technology and it makes you wonder what we could still learn from her. I've been working on recreating the lost site plans, and interpreting the position this individual was buried in.
""My interpretation suggests that the layout of the burial fits into a much wider trend extending as far south as North Yorkshire, and possibly much further beyond.""
What is known about Ava is that she was part of a much wider European group known as the Beaker people.
Short and round skull shapes were common amongst this group, but Ms Hoole said the Achavanich specimen is exaggerated and of an abnormal, uneven shape.
The archaeologist said: ""There has been much debate amongst the archaeological community for many decades about the shape. Some argue it is a hereditary trait, whilst others think there may have been a practice of head-binding which creates the distinct shape.
""Perhaps this site can contribute more to the debate if further research is undertaken.""
She added: ""She has been fondly nicknamed 'Ava', an abbreviation of the place she was found.
""Although potentially a controversial decision, I want people to remember that this is not just a cluster of bones, but that she was once a human being, with a name, an identity and a place in a long lost community.""","An archaeologist hopes to gain new insights into the life of a young woman who died more than 3,700 years ago."
169,"State department officials say Mr Kerry's appearance at the oversight panel should mean he will not need to testify in front of the recently-formed Benghazi select committee.
He is scheduled to testify on 12 June.
A US ambassador and three others were killed after an assault on the Libyan diplomatic post in September 2012.
Republicans have argued the Democratic Obama administration misled the public on the nature of the attack.
Democrats in the US Congress have named five representatives to a special panel on the Benghazi attacks despite arguing it is motivated by Republican politics.
Mr Kerry, who was not secretary at the time, had previously been subpoenaed by the oversight committee to appear in late May, the letter said, but could not attend due to the Ukrainian crisis.
""We believe there are witnesses better suited to answer questions regarding the department's response to congressional investigations of the Benghazi attacks,"" the letter, dated Friday, reads.
""However in the interest of accommodations and to resolve once and for all any outstanding, relevant questions, the secretary is prepared to appear before the committee.""
A separate select committee on Benghazi with the authorisation to operate until the end of the year was approved on a largely party-line vote.
Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told broadcaster NBC the decision whether to call Mr Kerry to testify at the select committee would be made later.
""We're glad Secretary Kerry will appear at oversight,"" Mr Steel said. ""Whether he will also be asked appear before the Select Committee will be a decision for Chairman Gowdy in the future.""","US Secretary of State John Kerry will testify in front of a House panel about the deadly Benghazi attacks, according to a letter obtained by the BBC."
170,"The controversial procedure involved widening a woman's pelvis during childbirth.
It is estimated up to 1,500 women underwent symphysiotomies between the mid-1940s and mid-1980s.
The proposed legislation will allow women to seek legal redress in court.
The legislation was introduced by Sinn Fein TD Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, who is the convenor of the cross-party group of TDs working on the issue.
The legislation proposed to set aside the statute of limitations for a year to allow victims to seek redress through the courts.
Symphysiotomy was a procedure carried out on mothers before or after labour.
The surgery increased the size of the pelvic area to allow easier delivery of a baby.
The procedure, sometimes carried out without consent or with no information given about its risks, has since been linked with chronic conditions such as pain, incontinence and mobility problems.
Its use began to decline in the late 1950s as confidence increased in the safety of repeated caesarean sections, but Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, County Louth, continued with the procedure until 1984.",A cross-party private members bill calling for the lifting of the statute of limitations for  symphysiotomy survivors has passed unopposed in the Irish parliament (Dáil).
171,"Young people increasingly are ditching the car, whilst older people, especially women, drive more than ever.
The Independent Transport Commission (ITC) also found that people are making fewer trips than they did twenty years ago, but those trips are longer.
Men under 35 are the most likely to shun the car, whilst women over 60 are driving more than ever.
One of the authors, Dr Matthew Niblett, director of the ITC, says: ""This report uncovers seismic shifts in patterns of individual travel behaviour.""
Here is what they found and this is all per person per year.
Overall: The number of trips English residents are making per person has fallen by 15% between 1995 and 2014. However, the average trip distance (all modes) has increased by 10% and the average trip time by almost 15%.
Rich vs Poor: The gap between rich and poor car driver miles is still large but has been narrowing. For the richest income quintile, car driver miles have fallen by 10% between 1996 and 2014 (to about 4500 per year); however, for the poorest quintile, miles driven have risen by almost 20% (to about 1200 per year).
Young vs Old: Young men (under 35) car driver miles have almost halved between 1996 and 2014 (to about 3700 per year), while for women over-60, car driver miles have more than doubled over the same period (to about 1800 per year).
London: In London the fall in car distance travelled per person has been dramatic, falling by almost a third in outer London, and by more than half for inner London.
Rail: The one thing people are doing a lot more more is catching the train, despite the fact that even allowing for inflation, fares have gone up by 25% since 1995. Average rail mileage per person has continued to rise sharply. This is due to a greater percentage of the population travelling by rail, rather than existing travellers making more or longer journeys.
Dr Niblett said: ""We are seeing that the historic correlations between incomes, costs and travel are weakening. An inter-generational divide in travel behaviour is growing.
""For young adults, cars are increasingly viewed as utilitarian appliances, rather than aspirational goods. And there are also growing differences in travel patterns between rural and urban areas.""",A major new study into how people travel around England shows a big difference between the generations.
172,"Jack Mount is accused of committing the offences in Birmingham, Shropshire and Yorkshire between 1954 and 1979.
The 95-year-old is the former head of privately-run Brookside School near Craven Arms in Shropshire.
Mr Mount, from Paradise Lawn in South Molton, Devon, has Parkinson's disease. He denies the allegations and is due to formally enter a plea in January.
The charges consist of nine counts of rape, six of gross indecency, nine of indecent assault and eight allegations of other sexual offences.
He is alleged to have committed the offences against six girls and six boys.
One offence was allegedly committed in Barnsley and then West Riding in the mid-1950s. Three are said to have occurred in Birmingham between 1957 and 1962.
The remaining 28 charges relate to allegations of sexual abuse against boys and girls in south Shropshire between 1967 and 1979.
Mr Mount appeared at both Birmingham Magistrates' Court and Birmingham Crown Court earlier. He was granted unconditional bail.",A former head teacher has appeared in court accused of 32 sex attacks against 12 children.
173,"""It's about taking a step away. Taking a couple of minutes to clear your head. There are just so many hats that we have to wear,  I feel like that's something we can all relate to nowadays.""
""We came up with the title first,"" she explains. ""It just sounded like a good old country song and we went from there"".
It tells the story of hard working small-town men and women, something which resonates with the 32-year-old, who was raised on her parents' farm in rural Oklahoma.
""When you never taking nothing and doing nothing but giving / It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian,"" she sings.
The lyrics lend themselves to her warm and controlled voice before she belts out the song's chorus: ""I don't smoke, but sometimes I need a long drag / Yeah, I know that might sound bad but sometimes I need a smoke break.""
Underwood has, like so many of her female country contemporaries, consistently maintained a wholesome public image. But with Smoke Break are we hearing a touch of rebellion?
""I do feel like people are watching me, especially coming off a show like American Idol. I definitely want to set a good example but I also try to live my life. We're all human and we all make mistakes.""
She readily admits that the men in her line of work rarely come under the same scrutiny: ""You have outlaw country singers who are expected to drink and get into a little bit of trouble every once in a whileâ€¦ but I really don't mind too much when I hear somebody say that they're glad their daughter listens to me. I think I do alright.""
Underwood gave birth to her first child, Isaiah, in February, after marrying ice hockey player Mike Fisher in 2010.
She can already count their seven-month-old as a fan.
""He likes it when I sing I think. If he's playing with a toy and then some commercial that's got a song in comes on the TV, he'll immediately stop what he's doing and be glued to the screen.""
Though she is happy to talk about motherhood, it's clear the singer does not want to be defined by her new family role: ""A lot of people expected me to write an album full of mummy songs or lullabies but I'm still me.""
But her son has ""worked his way a little bit into the album... I feel like that's one more dimension that I have that I can write about.""
Mainly though, Underwood is looking to tell great stories with her album - as its title Storyteller suggests.
""I want each track to be like listening to a mini movie through your speakers where you have to get to the end of the song to figure out how it all plays out.""
Blown Away, Underwood's last album, won two Grammys and sold nearly 1.8 million copies in the US alone.
Musically, there's been an evolution, giving this record ""a different overall feel, with a little more twang"".
While superstar contemporaries like Taylor Swift have made a concerted decision to move away from their country roots to appeal to a wider top 40 radio audience, Underwood is aiming for a ""a bit more of a traditional sound"".
""I think early on there was a lot of talk with people that I worked with trying to push me more in that direction,"" she explains. ""That's not me. That's just not what I grew up listening to. I can't see myself doing anything like that. I'm happy where I am.""
The US's biggest music market is country and Underwood is its biggest female star, so its small wonder the artist - who has sold 58 million records worldwide - is content to keep her fans pleased.
""Country music fans are the most loyal fans anybody could hope for,"" she says. ""You definitely have a greater chance of being able to make music longer - to find new things to write and sing about - and people will stay with you through it all.""
Recently, there has been a resurgent interest in country music in the UK.
Dolly Parton was a hit at last year's Glastonbury festival; British country act The Shires recently charted in the UK top 10 and the country music concert series C2C, which Underwood is headlining this year, is selling out arenas nationwide.
Does she think that people outside the US have been relatively slow to accept country until now?
""Definitely. Even in the States it's always had some stereotypes attached to it,"" she admits, ""But I want people everywhere to realise how relatable country music is to everyone.""
She says that it's ability to connect is down to the song writing: ""It's about life. They're real life lyrics. It's not just about dancing or your fancy car.""
Ten years of success, and a Greatest Hits album already under the belt in her early thirties may beg the question as to what's left for Underwood to achieve.
""I take it one week at a time,"" she laughs. ""My husband's hockey season starts back up so we'll be going through that as a family. If I look too far ahead I'm pretty overwhelmed.""
Ultimately, the aim, she says, is simple.
""I just want to be able to keep making music that I love, and that I believe in.""
Storyteller is released globally on 23 October.","After her longest break between studio albums and her first taste of motherhood, it's easy to see why country music star Carrie Underwood chose Smoke Break as her comeback track."

176,"Data from NHS Digital shows there were 29,544 hospital admissions in 2015-16 for allergic reactions.
That compares to 22,206 admissions in 2011-12.
Doctors say rising levels of cleanliness have lowered people's natural resistance to bacteria and dust which cause common allergies.
""The fact that we're living in a much cleaner world than a hundred years ago is the main factor behind the rise in the number of admissions for allergies,"" Dr Donald Hodge from the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust said.
""We've seen a huge increase in the number of referrals for children who have developed allergies, and this is undoubtedly because living in a cleaner world has lowered our ability to build up a resistance to substances like dust and pollen.""
An allergic reaction is caused when the body's immune system reacts disproportionately to a substance usually considered harmless.
Data about how many people in the UK suffer from an allergy is not conclusive but the charity Allergy UK claims that up to 50% of children are now diagnosed with an allergic condition.
NHS Digital will formally publish figures in November illustrating a steady rise in the number of hospital admissions where the primary reason for admission was due to an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock.
The admissions data is not a count of the number of people with an allergy but a tally of the number of incidents hospitals have to deal with each year.
The provisional figures show that some hospital trusts have recorded large increases in the number of admissions.
The University College London NHS Trust reported a 10-fold increase in the number of admissions for allergies. In 2015/16 the trust dealt with 1,163 allergy-related admissions compared with just 103 in 2011/12.
The rise in the number of people being admitted to hospital suffering an anaphylactic shock which is a severe form of reaction has been slightly lower.
Across England the number of anaphylactic admissions has gone up by 19%.
Ruby Scott from York had an anaphylactic shock in 2014 after she ate a curry containing nuts.
""As soon as I ate the chicken korma my lips started to tingle and swell up and I started to feel really sick"".
Ms Scott had specifically asked the Indian Garden restaurant in Easingwold to prepare the curry without nuts.
The owner, Mohammed Zaman, was jailed in May 2016 after he was found guilty of manslaughter after another customer died of a severe anaphylactic shock having eaten a dish that contained nuts.
Ruby said her condition means she will have a reaction even if she is in the same room as an open packet of nuts.

Mr Vucic was forced to flee the ceremony after being booed and heckled and then pelted with stones.
About 8,000 Muslims were killed in Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb forces during the Bosnian war.
Speaking in Belgrade after the attack, Mr Vucic said his glasses had been smashed in the incident but he was otherwise unhurt.
He said the attackers had been organised, but stressed he would continue his policy of rapprochement.
""I am sorry that some people didn't understand my sincere desire to build friendship between Serbs and Bosniaks,"" he said.

Mr Vucic is a former radical Serb nationalist who served under Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in the late 1990s.
He is now a pro-Western politician seeking to steer Serbia into the European Union. His government managed to secure support from its ally Russia on Wednesday to veto a UN resolution calling the events in Srebrenica a genocide.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered for the commemoration on Saturday in the eastern Bosnian town.
Witnesses said Mr Vucic had just laid a flower at a monument when parts of the crowd began chanting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God Is Great) and throwing stones.
Shielded by umbrellas, Mr Vucic and his bodyguards fled the ceremony.
In its statement, Bosnia's presidency - with members from each of the country's three main communities, Bosniak, Croat and Serb - apologised to ""all foreign delegations"" for the incident.
The Mayor of Srebrenica, Camil Durakovic, said the attack was ""the work of sick minds who abused this solemn event"".
Serbia, meanwhile, condemned the attack as an ""assassination attempt"".
Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic said it was an attack ""against all of Serbia and its policy of peace and regional co-operation"".
A funeral service for more than 100 victims whose remains were recently identified using DNA analysis was also held on Saturday.

178,"RCN head Peter Carter said he did not want relatives performing tasks nurses were employed to carry out, but that there were ""real benefits"" for patients when family members helped with care.
The Department of Health said family help needed to be alongside NHS care.
But patients' groups warned such a move could be ""the tip of the iceberg"".
Dr Carter, the RCN's general secretary, said the college was not suggesting families be compelled to carry out any tasks.
""We know that there are real benefits for patients where relatives can get involved in care, if that is what both the patient and family want,"" he said.
""We know from areas such as children's care that having familiar people involved at mealtimes for example can make hospital stays in particular less stressful for all concerned.
""What we would like to see is flexibility to allow relatives to help make patients comfortable, such as extending visiting times.""
Department of Health chief nursing officer Christine Beasley praised the ""amazing work"" work of carers and relatives and welcomed their help but added: ""This must be in addition to NHS care, not instead of it.
""Nurses should spend their time caring for patients and it is important to look at the way wards are run to help ensure this happens.""
""I expect all hospitals to ensure that they are providing safe, high quality nursing care because this must be at the heart of the NHS.""
But Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said patient care - including helping with feeding and taking patients to the toilet - should be carried out by nurses.
""It is just the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. ""Where will we draw the line?""
She added that some patients would not have families nearby or with the time to help out.
If there were not enough nurses to provide the care, then more nurses needed to be employed, she said.

The 41-year-old pleaded guilty to a series of charges including public indecency, assault and abduction.
He was detained in a secure hospital ahead of a review hearing in December.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard the Polish national has a lengthy criminal history, including previous convictions for robbery, hostage taking and burglary.
Prosecutors said the store CCTV of the incident at the Kingsway toy shop was ""extremely distressing and sensitive"".
Kaluzny entered the store carrying a baseball bat on 5 April this year before stripping naked. He walked down an aisle shouting and struggling with customers, placing them in a state of fear and alarm.
He then grabbed a six-year-old boy by the arm and dragged him along the ground, before picking him up in a bid to take him from the store against his will.
When the boy's 67-year-old grandmother tried to intervene, Kaluzny hit her on the head with a cricket bat, leaving her injured.
Although he was eventually subdued by other customers and police, Kaluzny then managed to snap the metal bar and plastic casing of a pair of handcuffs while in a police car.
His defence solicitor Nicola Brown said he had written ""what is a letter of apology, in essence"", which is to be translated for the court.

186,"The New York Times says flagged messages were made available to the FBI, but the scans have now stopped.
It adds that the tech company adapted one of its spam and child-abuse-image filters to carry out the task.
The details build on an earlier report by the news agency Reuters.
Yahoo declined to add to its previous statements, in which it said Reuters' report was ""misleading"" and that it was ""a law-abiding firm"".
The California-based company also said the mail-scanning process outlined by Reuters ""does not exist"" on its systems, but did not explicitly address whether it had done so previously.
The New York Times says its report is based on interviews with two unnamed US government officials and a third anonymous person ""familiar with"" Yahoo.
It says that FBI investigators had learned that agents of a foreign terrorist body were using Yahoo's email service.
The bureau had managed to discover a ""highly unique identifier or signature"" used by the terrorists, it adds, but had been unable to indentify which accounts were being used, and so wanted Yahoo's aid.
It says that a judge at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was persuaded that the string of characters would have been used only by a foreign power, and so agreed to issue an order for Yahoo to comply.
The US law governing what can and cannot be scanned is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa).
The original version, passed in 1978, set out strict conditions under which a special court could authorise electronic surveillance if suspects were believed to be engaged in espionage or planning an attack against the US on behalf of a foreign power.
Following the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration secretly gave the NSA permission to bypass the court and carry out warrantless surveillance of al-Qaeda suspects, among others.
After this emerged in 2005, Congress voted to both offer immunity to the firms that had co-operated with the NSA's requests and to make amendments to Fisa.
A relaxation to the rules, introduced in 2008, meant officials could now obtain court orders without having to identify each individual target or detail the specific types of communications they intended to monitor so long as they convinced the court their purpose was to gather ""foreign intelligence information"".
In addition, they no longer had to confirm both the sender and receiver of the messages were outside the US, but only had to show it was ""reasonable"" to believe one of the parties was outside the country.
Yahoo had previously handed over data about its users to US cyber-spies - a fact it fought a legal battle to be able to reveal - but only after unsuccessfully appealing against the demand
But Reuters's article said that it had not challenged last year's order, a decision that allegedly disappointed some of its staff and led to the resignation of its chief information security officer.
A Fisa court order would restrict Yahoo from discussing the matter.
But the reports have raised privacy concerns and prompted US lawmakers and the EU's lead data protection commissioner to say they are looking into the allegations.
""This is a perfect example of why we need to reform [the Fisa Amendments Act],"" said the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights campaign group.
""Absent such reform, congress must not reauthorise section 702 [of Fisa, which permits warrantless surveillance] when it expires at the end of next year.""","Yahoo scanned its users' incoming emails for an unusual string of characters that had been linked to a terrorist organisation, according to a fresh report about the matter."
187,"The Prison Officers Association (POA) said 35 of its members at Maidstone Prison were backing a female colleague who was ""badly assaulted"" by an inmate.
It said the officers occupied the prison's visitors' hall after ""withdrawing their labour"".
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the staff returned to work at 12:10 GMT.
The POA said the dispute concerned a female officer who had needed surgery and was now on half pay following her injury.
The MoJ said the salary issue was caused by a computer error which had now been rectified.
Emergency teams had to be called in to deal with a disturbance at Maidstone Prison in November 2013, which involved about 40 inmates.
It was brought to an end within three hours without injuries to staff or prisoners, according to the MoJ.
Maidstone is a Category C men's jail which until last summer summer held a mix of foreign nationals and sex offenders, but now holds only foreign nationals.
Category C prisons are for inmates who cannot be trusted in open conditions but who are unlikely to try to escape.
The MoJ said the woman officer was not injured in the disturbance last November.

""I wouldn't do that to Rambo,"" he told the BBC. ""That's like blasphemy.""
The movie is being launched at the Cannes Film Festival - though filming doesn't start until later this year.
Indian star Tiger Shroff is taking on the titular role.
On his decision to launch the project in Cannes, Anand said: ""Rambo is a global icon. He resonates in every part of the world, so it's important to start our campaign at the Mecca of film-making.""
He said he was driven to remake the movie because of the strength of the character of the ""true blue action hero with a heart"", immortalised by Stallone.
Anand said he had a script which will ""resonate in India"" - but warned: ""It could be controversial like Rambo First Blood was in the 80s.
""It makes you think, and is about a situation that's prevailing in India and is unique in that way.""
Stallone had posted a message on social media last week, saying Rambo was a ""great character"", adding: ""Hope they don't wreck it.""
But he later sent a message to Shroff himself, wishing him the best of luck.
""He has been kind enough to Tweet about it. It's like an endorsement from God himself,"" said Anand.
Asked what fans of the original will think, he said: ""I'm aware there will be polarised reaction from the fans of Rambo who don't want it messed with. I have to make it worthy of the legacy of what Rambo means.
""Those kinds of films aren't really made any more. So that made me excited to bring it to a young generation.""
Shroff, 27, said he thought the project was ""too good to be true"" when he was first approached about it.
He said: ""In my eyes, Sylvester Stallone will always be Rambo. He's my hero.
""I don't want to replace him, but to give a different take on it. They are huge shoes to fill.""
Shroff told the BBC it was ""heart-warming"" to receive social media messages from Stallone.

191,"The technology allows a convoy of lorries to travel just a few feet from each other, with just the driver at the front in control.
The initiative would cut fuel consumption, backers said.
However, the plan has been criticised by motoring groups which said such a fleet would be ""intimidating"" to other road users.
The Sunday Times reported that UK ministers had visited Sweden to see the technology in action, and that tests would be carried out next year.
However in a statement, the Department for Transport said: ""No decision has been reached on a trial using this new technology.
""However, road safety remains of paramount importance and will not be compromised.""
The technology still requires a driver to be in each vehicle in the event of an emergency, but for the most part drivers will be able to relax - the proposal suggested reading a book or having lunch.
The convoy will be controlled by the driver in the front, with each lorry communicating via wi-fi. Infrared cameras and laser sensors are also used to monitor vehicle movements.
Paul Watters, head of road policy for breakdown rescue service the AA, said the idea may concern normal road users.
""For the car user in particular it does pose worries about platooning lorries taking up a lot of space and blocking others out,"" he told the BBC, but added that perhaps a dedicated lane may solve that issue.
He questioned whether the notion that drivers could take up another activity while in the autonomous convoy was misjudged.
""They're suggesting that an autonomous lorry driver can do other logistics work while they're driving,"" he said.
""The thought of a lorry driver doing administration is, dare I say it, pie in the sky.""
The plans follow the announcement that driverless cars will be tested in the UK next year. The news was met with some trepidation - 65% of people polled by the AA said they would prefer to continue driving as normal rather than allow a computer to take the wheel.
But the organisation noted that younger drivers appeared to be more open to the technology.

Yn wreiddiol o Sir Benfro, mae wedi bod yn gweithio fel newyddiadurwr ers bron i 40 mlynedd, a bydd nifer yn ei gofio fel un o brif leisiau'r BBC yn dilyn ymosodiadau terfysgol 9/11 yn 2001.
Yn gweithio fel gohebydd busnes Gogledd America ar y pryd, roedd ar lawr gwaelod y World Trade Center pan wnaeth yr awyren gyntaf daro'r adeilad.
Bu wedyn yn cyfrannu'n helaeth i gynulleidfaoedd Radio Cymru a Newyddion 9 dros y dyddiau wedi hynny, yn ogystal â nifer o wasanaethau eraill y BBC.
Bu'n rhannu ychydig o'i hanes fel newyddiadurwr, a'r hyn sydd wedi newid dros y pedwar degawd diwethaf, gyda Cymru Fyw:
""Fe wnes i hyfforddi ar y Western Telegraph, a phan ddechreues i roedd papurau newydd yn rhan enfawr o fywyd Cymreig,"" meddai.
""Roedd gan y Western Telegraph ddau bapur pan oeddwn i'n dechrau yn Hwlffordd, ond mae llawer o hynny wedi mynd erbyn hyn.
""Byddai pawb yn Sir Benfro yn darllen y Telegraph, ac roedd pobl yn llythrennol ar bigau drain i'w gael o. Byddai pobl yn disgwyl amdano.
""Roedden ni'n gwneud ysgrif goffa am bron i bawb fyddai'n marw yn y sir.
""Roedd hyfforddi i fod yn ohebydd bryd hynny yn wych - fyddech chi ddim yn meiddio cael pethau'n anghywir, oherwydd os byddai gennych chi wallau byddai pobl yn llythrennol yn dod i mewn i'r swyddfa a chwyno.""
Ymunodd â'r BBC gyda Radio 4 yn 1988, cyn symud i fod yn ohebydd. Yn fwy diweddar mae wedi bod yn ohebydd yn Berlin a Seoul.

Ai dyma'r diwedd i newyddion traddodiadol felly? Yw'r cyfryngau cymdeithasol wedi gwneud hynny'n ddiangen?

193,"Project chairman, Bertrand Piccard, piloted the vehicle from Muscat in Oman to Ahmedabad in India, crossing the Arabian Sea in the process.
Tuesday's journey took just over 15 hours.
The distance covered - 1,468km - set a new world record for a flight in a piloted solar-powered plane.
The vehicle has another 10 legs ahead of it over the course of the next five months.
Included in that itinerary will be demanding stretches when the craft has to fly over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
Piccard is sharing the flying duties with project partner and CEO, Andre Borschberg, who made Monday's inaugural trip from Abu Dhabi to Muscat.
Solar Impulse arrived in Ahmedabad in darkness, its wings illuminated by LEDs, and its propellers driven by the energy stored in its batteries.
The plane had left Muscat at 06.35 (02:35 GMT) and put its wheels down at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 23.25 local time (17:55 GMT).
Preparations are already under way for the next leg to Varanasi in northeast India, although mission planners say that will not be for another four days, at least.
The time will be spent carrying a campaigning message on the topic of clean technologies to the local Ahmedabad people, and the wider Indian population.
The Solar Impulse project has already set plenty of other world records for solar-powered flight, including making a high-profile transit of the US in 2013.
But the round-the-world venture is altogether more dramatic and daunting, and has required the construction of an even bigger plane than the prototype, Solar Impulse-1.
This new model has a wingspan of 72m, which is wider than a 747 jumbo jet. And yet, it weighs only 2.3 tonnes.
Its light weight will be critical to its success.
So, too, will the performance of the 17,000 solar cells that line the top of the wings, and the energy-dense lithium-ion batteries it will use to sustain night-time flying.
Operating through darkness will be particularly important when the men have to cross the Pacific and the Atlantic.
The slow speed of their prop-driven plane means these legs will take several days and nights of non-stop flying to complete.
Piccard and Borschberg - they take it in turns to fly solo - will have to stay alert for nearly all of the time they are airborne.
They will be permitted only catnaps of up to 20 mins - in the same way a single-handed, round-the-world yachtsman would catch small periods of sleep.
They will also have to endure the physical discomfort of being confined in a cockpit that measures just 3.8 cubic metres in volume - not a lot bigger than a public telephone box.
The Solar Impulse venture recalls other great circumnavigation feats in aviation - albeit fuelled ones.
In 1986, the Voyager aircraft became the first to fly around the world without stopping or refuelling.
Piloted by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, the propeller-driven vehicle took nine days to complete its journey.
Then, in 2005, this time was beaten by the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, which was solo-piloted by Steve Fossett.
A jet-powered plane, GlobalFlyer completed its non-stop circumnavigation in just under three days.
Andre Borschberg is a trained engineer and former air-force pilot, he has built a career as an entrepreneur in internet technologies.
Bertrand Piccard is well known for his ballooning exploits. Along with Brian Jones, he completed the first non-stop, circumnavigation of the world in 1999, using the Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon. The Piccard name has become synonymous with pushing boundaries.
Bertrand's father, Jacques Piccard, was the first to reach the deepest place in the ocean (a feat achieved with Don Walsh in the Trieste bathyscaphe in 1960). And his grandfather, Auguste Piccard, was the first person to take a balloon into the stratosphere, in 1931.

Last week, Health Minister Simon Hamilton announced his intention to abolish the board but said it could not happen until April 2017.
Sir Liam says it should happen sooner.
""The last thing you want is an organisation which is dying in management terms running the show for years,"" he said.
Mr Hamilton rejected Sir Liam's idea that an international panel should be given the power to make difficult decisions such as reducing the number of acute hospitals.
Instead, the health minister believes the panel should be made up of Northern Ireland experts and politicians should make the decisions.
""He has talked of political courage and political consensus - so whilst the letter of the recommendation of bringing in an external panel to advise is not being taken - the spirit of it very much is,"" he added.
Many of the 600 staff at the Health and Social Care Board are expected to be redeployed to the Department of Health or the trusts, but Sir Liam says real savings are needed.
""I would expect to see a reduction in unnecessary management costs because ultimately that same money can be redeployed to frontline patient care where it is very very badly needed,"" he said.",A senior medical expert who reviewed how the health system is run in Northern Ireland says the Health and Social Care Board should be done away with as soon as possible.

Volunteers packed the shipment in an operation that took up to three hours.
The charity, which has its base in Fratton, opened a second collection point at a pub in Alton to cope with the number of donations.
Susannah Stredder, the landlady of The George pub, said: ""Every day for the last three weeks we've had a room full of donations to sort out, box up, label and get ready for the container that's going to take it all over to Syria.""",A container of donated goods to help people in war-torn Syria has started its journey.
196,"The club - relegated from the Premier League this past season - have also brought in Joe Royle as a football consultant.
Holt left his role as Falkirk boss to take up the position, while Robson continues in a role he took up at the end of the the last campaign.
Royle was Adams's manager at Oldham between 1989 and 1994.
Adams told the Norwich website: ""Mark and Gary are two people I've worked with closely and both will bring enthusiasm, hunger and experience to the coaching team.
""They have also played at the highest levels in this country.
""Joe is someone who I have played for at both Championship and Premier League level, and he has amassed a vast amount of knowledge during his time in the game.
""He has been there, seen it and done it, so to speak, and has also been very successful during his time as both a player and a manager.""
Holt is back at Norwich having left his role in the Carrow Road youth set-up to become head coach of Falkirk in April 2013.
The Scot, who played for Norwich between 2001 and 2005, led Falkirk to a third-place finish in the Scottish Championship this season.
Falkirk had initially released a statement saying Holt was set to join Norwich and they were actively seeking a replacement.
However, the club amended that stance, saying that a formal agreement was still to be reached, before the appointment was confirmed.
Gary Locke, who has left relegated Hearts, was immediately installed as bookmakers' favourite for the role at Falkirk Stadium ahead of exiting St Mirren manager Danny Lennon, Stephen Aitken, who led League One side Stranraer to the promotion play-offs, and former Dundee United boss Peter Houston, presently scouting for Celtic.

197,"Bees, butterflies and birds returned to remote mountaintops in the Seychelles only six months after exotic plants were removed.
Taking out exotic plants seems to make native plants more accessible to pollinators, say scientists.
Plants have been moved around the world for centuries, meaning native and exotic plants often grow side-by-side.
There has been debate over the loss of plant biodiversity in some parts of the world, as ""alien"" plants invade ecosystems.
The study was carried out on the tropical island of Mahé in the Seychelles, an island archipelago in the Indian Ocean off East Africa.
International researchers monitored pollinators at eight isolated areas on the top of mountains.
Four of them had all exotic shrubs (about 40,000 woody plants) removed, while the others remained unchanged.
Over an eight-month monitoring period, the removal of exotic plants appeared to improve pollination.
In restored sites, plants produced more flowers and attracted more visits from pollinating animals, which was linked with the production of more fruit.
Meanwhile, the number of pollinator species (including bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, moths, beetles, birds and lizards) was higher in the cleared areas six to 14 months after exotic species had been removed.
""Ecosystem restoration resulted in a marked increase in pollinator species, visits to flowers and interaction diversity,"" said a team led by Christopher Kaiser-Bunbury of TU Darmstadt in Germany.
""Our results show that vegetation restoration can improve pollination, suggesting that the degradation of ecosystem functions is at least partially reversible. ""
The research is published in the journal Nature.

199,"Wales' Lydiate, 28, collided with team-mate Aaron Jarvis in a 12-7 win over Newport Gwent Dragons on 1 January.
But Ospreys have registered scrum-half Rhys Webb in their European squad in place of young wing Dafydd Howells.
Webb - who has not played since injuring a foot while playing for Wales on 5 September - is not expected to play against Exeter, but is eligible.
