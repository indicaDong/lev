0,"The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.
Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.
Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.
Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.
The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.
Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.
However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.
""It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,"" she said.
""That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.
""Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?""
Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.
Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.
Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.
The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.
He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.
""I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,"" he said.
""Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.""
He said it was important that ""immediate steps"" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

1,"A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.
As they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.
One of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.
The driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.
Both groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.
Police have appealed for information about the attack.
Insp David Gibson said: ""It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.
""While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.""",Two tourist buses have been destroyed by fire in a suspected arson attack in Belfast city centre.
2,"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.
Sebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.
The world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.
But stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said ""no clear instruction was given on where he should park"".
Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.
Vandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer ""did a good job and I didn't"".
Mercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.
After the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.
But Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.
Vettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.
The gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.
Vettel said: ""Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.""
Vandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.
The Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.
He also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.
Button was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.
The 24-year-old said: ""I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.
""Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.""
Button, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: ""Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.""
The controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.
FIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he ""felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance"", adding: ""We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.""
The system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.
But it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.
Only one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.
The teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.
Todt said he was ""optimistic"" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.
""We should listen to the people watching on TV,"" Rosberg said. ""If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.""
Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.
Ricciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.
German Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.

3,"John Edward Bates, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, faces a total of 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child.
The 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989.
Mr Bates denies all the charges.
Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.
""The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,"" said Mrs Hale.
The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.
She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.
Mrs Hale said: ""The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.""
She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.
Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.
The jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.
The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.","A former Lincolnshire Police officer carried out a series of sex attacks on boys, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court was told."
4,"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.
Officers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.
Earlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.
The chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been ""no hostage crises"", adding that the man was ""alone in the room"".
Dr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.
He said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.
""His firearm was taken away,"" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.
The incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.","An armed man who locked himself into a room at a psychiatric hospital in Istanbul has ended his threat to kill himself, Turkish media report."
5,"Simone Favaro got the crucial try with the last move of the game, following earlier touchdowns by Chris Fusaro, Zander Fagerson and Junior Bulumakau.
Rynard Landman and Ashton Hewitt got a try in either half for the Dragons.
Glasgow showed far superior strength in depth as they took control of a messy match in the second period.
Home coach Gregor Townsend gave a debut to powerhouse Fijian-born Wallaby wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, and centre Alex Dunbar returned from long-term injury, while the Dragons gave first starts of the season to wing Aled Brew and hooker Elliot Dee.
Glasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.
It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.
Glasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.
But the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.
The visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly.
It was Glasgow's bench experience that showed when Mike Blair's break led to a short-range score from teenage prop Fagerson, converted by Clegg.
Debutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try.
The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.
However, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.
Dragons director of rugby Lyn Jones said: ""We're disappointed to have lost but our performance was a lot better [than against Leinster] and the game could have gone either way.
""Unfortunately too many errors behind the scrum cost us a great deal, though from where we were a fortnight ago in Dublin our workrate and desire was excellent.
""It was simply error count from individuals behind the scrum that cost us field position, it's not rocket science - they were correct in how they played and we had a few errors, that was the difference.""

6,"Veronica Vanessa Chango-Alverez, 31, was killed and another man injured when an Audi A3 struck them in Streatham High Road at 05:30 GMT on Saturday.
Ten minutes before the crash the car was in London Road, Croydon, when a Volkswagen Passat collided with a tree.
Police want to trace Nathan Davis, 27, who they say has links to the Audi. The car was abandoned at the scene.
Ms Chango-Alverez died from multiple injuries, a post-mortem examination found.
No arrests have been made as yet, police said.
Ms Chango-Alverez was staying at her mother's home in Streatham High Road.
She was born in Ecuador and had lived in London for 13 years, BBC London reporter Gareth Furby said. At the time of the crash, she was on her way to work in a hotel.
The remains of the bus stop, which was extensively damaged in the crash, have been removed.
Flowers have been left at the site in tribute to the victim.
A statement from her brother Kevin Raul Chango-Alverez said: ""My family has had its heart torn out, at this Christmas time, we will never be the same again.
""On Friday night we were together as a family with Veronica meeting her newly born nephew and preparing for Christmas.
""I last saw her alive as she left to go to work on Saturday morning, but moments later I was holding her hand as she passed away in the street.""
Describing the crash as ""horrific"" Det Insp Gordon Wallace, said: ""The family are devastated. The memory of this senseless death will be with them each time they leave their home.
""The driver fled the scene abandoning the grey Audi, which was extensively damaged.

7,"Belgian cyclist Demoitie died after a collision with a motorbike during Belgium's Gent-Wevelgem race.
The 25-year-old was hit by the motorbike after several riders came down in a crash as the race passed through northern France.
""The main issues come when cars or motorbikes have to pass the peloton and pass riders,"" Team Sky's Rowe said.
""That is the fundamental issue we're looking into.
""There's a lot of motorbikes in and around the race whether it be cameras for TV, photographers or police motorbikes.
""In total there's around 50 motorbikes that work on each race.
""We've got a riders union and we're coming together to think of a few ideas, whether we cap a speed limit on how fast they can overtake us.
""Say we put a 10 kilometres per hour limit on it, if we're going 50kph they're only allowed to pass us 60kph or something like that.""
Demoitie, who was riding for the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to hospital in Lille but died later.
The sport's governing body, the UCI, said it would co-operate with all relevant authorities in an investigation into the incident.
The Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) issued a statement asking what would be done to improve safety.
Despite Demoitie's death, attitudes to road racing will stay the same says Rowe, who has been competing in Three Days of De Panne race in Belgium.
""As soon as that element of fear slips into your mind and you start thinking of things that could happen, that's when you're doomed to fail,"" he told BBC Wales Sport.
""If you start thinking about crashes and the consequences and what could potentially happen then you're never going to be at the front of the peloton and you're never going to win any races.""
In a separate incident, another Belgian cyclist, Daan Myngheer, 22, died in hospital after suffering a heart attack during the first stage of the Criterium International in Corsica.",Welsh cyclist Luke Rowe says changes to the sport must be made following the death of Antoine Demoitie.
8,"Gundogan, 26, told BBC Sport he ""can see the finishing line"" after tearing cruciate knee ligaments in December, but will not rush his return.
The German missed the 2014 World Cup following back surgery that kept him out for a year, and sat out Euro 2016 because of a dislocated kneecap.
He said: ""It is heavy mentally to accept that.""
Gundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in ""weeks"" rather than months.
He told BBC Sport: ""It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick.
""The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.""
Gundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund.
He is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
Manager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.
Gundogan said: ""Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely.
""We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.""
City complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday.
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.
Spurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.
And Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.
He said: ""Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.
""They are really uncomfortable to play against.
""I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.""",Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan says it has been mentally tough to overcome a third major injury.

11,"Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.
Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.
Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.
The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a ""dongle"" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.
""That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,"" Mr Newlin said.
By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.
The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).
The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).
Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.
The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.
Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.
Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.
Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,
But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.","Hackers could gain access to home and corporate networks via security flaws in wireless mice, suggests research."

13,"The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday.
The EC said that its ""preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid.""
However, Amazon said it ""has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg"".
""We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],"" it said.
The Luxembourg finance ministry said: ""Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted,"" it said.
The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules.
The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation.
The Commission said it had ""no indication"" that the tax arrangement was ""compatible with the internal market"".
The current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck.
Mr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax  avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg.
Commission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's ""transfer pricing"" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries.
Doubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said.
The Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether ""Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty"" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company.
""If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,"" the EC said.
It added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal.
Luxembourg's finance ministry said it ""has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation.""
""Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,"" it added.
Luxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected ""sweetheart"" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat.
In addition, Ireland's tax deal with Apple and the Netherlands' arrangement with Starbucks are being scrutinised as part of a crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes.","The European Commission has disclosed a preliminary finding that Amazon's tax arrangements in Luxembourg probably constitute ""state aid""."
14,"The three-day extravaganza of farming, food and family fun celebrates many aspects of agricultural life.
The Balmoral Show is run by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) and dates back 148 years.
Last year, it attracted more than 90,000 visitors to its recently-adopted home outside Lisburn in County Antrim.
It was traditionally staged at the RUAS's headquarters in south Belfast, but the show moved to a larger venue on the site of the former Maze prison in 2013.
The Maze venue, re-named Balmoral Park, is now hosting the show for the fourth consecutive year.
The 2016 event coincides with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, and local produce features prominently in the exhibitions.
One of this year's highlights is an ""edible garden"", in which visitors can see their food growing in the ground before it gets to their plates.
The aim of the garden is to encourage people to grow their own food at home.
The event will also showcase the best of local livestock, with prized pigs, cattle, poultry and ponies all lining up in bid to be the stars of the show.
Their owners will also get a chance to shine, with horse riding and show jumping displays along with sheep shearing competitions and awards for the best livestock breeders and handlers.
For younger visitors, there is a family fun area hosting displays from the Northern Ireland School of Falconry as well as a gun dog skills demonstration and a performance from balloon artist Bruce Airhead.

15,"Mr Mosley wants Google to block photos of him at a sex party first printed in the now-defunct News of the World, which he successfully sued in 2008.
He is suing the internet firm for breaches of the Data Protection Act and misusing private information.
Google's barrister argued that Mr Mosley no longer has a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"".
Mr Mosley won damages from the News of the World after it published a story alleging he had organised a Nazi-themed orgy.
Photographs and a video which show his private sexual activity were originally obtained by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN) in a clandestine ""sting"" operation.
Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached.
In that ruling, the High Court also said the article was not in the public interest.
Mr Mosley has said the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual and private.
On launching his legal action last year, Mr Mosley urged: ""Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself. It cannot be allowed to ignore judgements in our courts.""
Google has said it will remove URLs that it is alerted to, but is not prepared to remove the images entirely from its search engines.
In court on Wednesday, Google's barrister Antony White QC for Google conceded that it was technically possible to remove the images and was ""not burdensome"" to do so.
However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images.
On that basis, Google will seek to show that Mr Mosley's claim is unfounded.
The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday.",Google has asked the High Court to throw out legal action being taken by ex-Formula 1 boss Max Mosley.

Mr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger.
A former left-wing rebel, Mr Ortega has led Nicaragua through a period of economic stability which has made him popular with the country's business sector and foreign investors.
Supporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory.
But even before the first results were announced, members of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) called the elections a ""farce"".
The FAD, which had urged voters to boycott the election, alleged that more than 70% had abstained from voting.
They were contradicted by the electoral authorities which put voter participation at 65.8%.
Mr Ortega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who now looks set to become vice-president.
Analysts say that Ms Murillo already shares decision-making with Mr Ortega and could become president if her 70-year-old husband were to bow out.
Nicaragua's economy has grown at double the Latin American average, but the country still needs to attract more foreign investment.
A $50bn (£40bn) plan to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua with Chinese investment has gained international attention, but there are serious doubts over whether it will ever be built.
The country has been able to avoid the sky-high murder rates of some of its Central American neighbours but it also faces the ever pervasive threat of drug-trafficking.","The US says it is ""deeply concerned"" about the electoral process in Nicaragua a day after Daniel Ortega, the left-wing leader, won a third consecutive presidential term."
20,"The decision comes after 170,000 activists from around the world demanded action to help lesbians targeted for ""corrective rape"".
The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent killing and rape of lesbian activist Noxolo Nogwaza.
Police say they do not consider sexual orientation when investigating murder.
""To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender,"" police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible Ms Nogwaza's death.
She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend.
Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships.
They say ""corrective rape"" - when a lesbian is raped to either punish her, or ""correct"" her behaviour - is becoming increasingly common.
Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organisation Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement.
She said it was important to get ""corrective rape"" classified as a hate crime.
""The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,"" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme.
Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action.
""In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously,"" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying.
Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, police and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community.
""The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex]-sensitive shelters,"" he said.
In 2008, female footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg.
Two people were given long prison terms for her murder and rape, although prosecutors denied that her sexuality had been a motive.","South Africa is to set up a team to tackle hate crimes against gay people, the justice ministry says."

22,"That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.
The hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.
This suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.
This argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.
Nonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.
""We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,"" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.
They then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.
""If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,"" Mr Hsiung explained.
Given that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated ""the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this"".
The answer? ""Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times.""
What is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.
The team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.
They used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a ""structural colour"" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.
The results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.
""That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,"" Mr Hsiung said.
""If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place.""
So why did all these different species acquire the same colour?
Given their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.
That is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.
""It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,"" Mr Hsiung said. ""That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.
""But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.""
It may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.
""We don't know yet,"" Mr Hsiung said.

23,"Internet searches from the week before the crash were found on the tablet computer used by Andreas Lubitz,
Meanwhile, the second ""black box"" flight recorder from the plane has been recovered.
There were no survivors among the 150 people on board the A320 on 24 March.
The German prosecutors said internet searches made on the tablet found in Lubitz's Duesseldorf flat included ""ways to commit suicide"" and ""cockpit doors and their security provisions"".
Spokesman Ralf Herrenbrueck said: ""He concerned himself on one hand with medical treatment methods, on the other hand with types and ways of going about a suicide.
""In addition, on at least one day he concerned himself with search terms about cockpit doors and their security precautions.''
Prosecutors did not disclose the individual search terms in the browser history but said personal correspondence supported the conclusion Lubitz used the device in the period from 16 to 23 March.
Lubitz, 27, had been deemed fit to fly by his employers at Germanwings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa.
The first ""black box"", the voice recorder, was recovered almost immediately at the crash site.
Based on that evidence, investigators said they believed Lubitz intentionally crashed Flight 9525, which was travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, taking control of the aircraft while the pilot was locked out of the cockpit.
The second ""black box"" recovered is the flight data recorder (FDR) which should hold technical information on the time of radio transmissions and the plane's acceleration, airspeed, altitude and direction, plus the use of auto-pilot.
At a press conference, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said there was ""reasonable hope"" the recorder which was being sent to Paris for examination, would provide useful information.
The ""completely blackened"" equipment was found near a ravine and was not discovered immediately because it was the same colour as the rocks, he said.
He said: ""The second black box is an indispensable addition to understand what happened especially in the final moment of the flight.""
He told the media 150 separate DNA profiles had been isolated from the crash site but he stressed that did not mean all the victims had been identified.
As each DNA set is matched to a victim, families will be notified immediately, he said,
He added 40 mobile phones had been recovered. He said they would be analysed in a laboratory but were ""heavily damaged"".
Also on Thursday, Germanwings said it was unaware that Lubitz had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot.
Lufthansa confirmed on Tuesday that it knew six years ago that the co-pilot had suffered from an episode of ""severe depression'' before he finished his flight training.
``We didn't know this,'' said Vanessa Torres, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, which hired Lubitz in September 2013.
She could not explain why Germanwings had not been informed.
The final minutes
Lubitz began the jet's descent at 10:31 (09:31 GMT) on 24 March, shortly after the A320 had made its final contact with air traffic control.
Little more than eight minutes later, it had crashed into a mountain near Seyne-les-Alpes.

Who was Andreas Lubitz?","The co-pilot suspected of deliberately crashing the Germanwings jet in the French Alps had researched suicide methods and the security of cockpit doors, German prosecutors said."
24,"Mr Fox, 54, from London, denies eight counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault between 1988 and 2014.
He said there was often ""horseplay"" with colleagues, involving ""piggybacks, tickling and squeezing"".
But he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual.
Mr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell.
He joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.
Giving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with ""hundreds"" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.
Under questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.
""It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.""
He said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a ""full performance"" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.
Mr Caplan asked: ""Could those comments become edgy or sexual?""
Mr Fox replied: ""Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.""
Referring to the ""horseplay"" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, ""otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio"".
Asked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: ""I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?
""Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.""
He added: ""But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then.""
One former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: ""That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do.""
The complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.
Addressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a ""play-acting high jinks thing"", he said.
Mr Fox told the court he had seen it ""many times"", but agreed that out of context, the ""Benny Hill-style"" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.
Prosecutor John Price QC said: ""She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?""
Mr Fox replied: ""I can't get in (her) head.""
Mr Price continued: ""Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?"" to which the defendant replied: ""No.""
Mr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.
""It never happened,"" he said, although he did acknowledge he ""could have easily taken her for a tour"".
Mr Fox agreed it would be ""quite wrong"" for an adult man to ""stick his tongue"" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.
If a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with ""a social kiss"" on the cheek, he said.
The girl in question had, he added, ""become a little bit obsessed with me"".
Asked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: ""I don't have an explanation at all.""
Mr Price said: ""Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?""
The DJ replied: ""I can't explain those coincidences.""
The trial continues.","DJ Neil Fox has told a court he engaged in ""saucy"" behaviour at work, but complaints made against him in 2014 were the first in his 29-year career."

26,"He would go upstairs, on the premise that he was saying a prayer with his niece, then sexually abuse her.
Now in her 30s, Karen wasn't understood when she first told her parents what her uncle, Mark Sewell, was doing.
Sewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder.
Christian churches, as well as other religions, have faced claims of child abuse.
But what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house.
Because of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases.
However, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man.
When she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.
Later, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.
Afterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.
This bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a ""judicial committee"" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.
Karen, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.
The elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.
Despite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.
He is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.
His punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.
Even when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.
Karen's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.
In a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.
Confidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.
Nowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.
The Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.
In a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.
Their statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.
Karen Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.
For both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.
The organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves ""disfellowshipped"" or shunned.
Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.
For many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.
Other churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.
That inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.
However, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.
Only this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.
Todros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.
The case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.
The court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been ""ostracised"" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.
For young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.
Sexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.
Many religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.
The survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.
The Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:
Local authorities
The police
The Crown Prosecution Service
The Immigration Service
The BBC
The armed forces
Schools
Hospitals
Children's homes
Churches, mosques and other religious organisations
Charities and voluntary organisations

27,"Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will ""go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever"".
The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday.
The bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures.
In a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: ""This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation.""
Asked how long that would take, he replied: ""It has failed already.""
Mr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently.
He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign.
""We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy.""
Mr Tsipras has announced a cabinet reshuffle, sacking several ministers who voted against the reforms in parliament this week.
But he opted not to bring in technocrats or opposition politicians as replacements.
As a result, our correspondent says, Mr Tsipras will preside over ministers who, like himself, harbour serious doubts about the reform programme.
Greece must pass further reforms on Wednesday next week to secure the bailout.
Germany was the last of the eurozone countries needing parliamentary approval to begin the talks.
But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks.
On Saturday, the Greek government ordered banks to open on Monday following three weeks of closures.
But the decree stated that the weekly withdrawal limit should be a maximum €420.
Separately, the European Council approved the €7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states.
It means Greece will now be able to repay debts to two of its creditors, the ECB and International Monetary Fund (IMF), due on Monday.","Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has told the BBC that economic reforms imposed on his country by creditors are ""going to fail"", ahead of talks on a huge bailout."
28,"The IPC opened proceedings against the National Paralympic Committee of Russia after a report claimed the country had operated a widespread doping programme.
A decision on any ban will come in the week commencing 1 August.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opted against a blanket ban.
""I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the interest of the Paralympic movement moving forward,"" said Craven.
On Sunday, the IOC said it would leave it up to the governing bodies of individual sports to decide if Russian competitors are clean and should be allowed to take part.
But Craven, himself a member of the IOC, was critical of that decision and said the IPC would not necessarily follow suit.
""I am disappointed in their decision, but that is a personal view,"" he added.
""We have to acknowledge their right to take such a decision. This is ultra-serious. I don't think there has been a situation in the past where you have had institutional doping on such a scale.
""We believe the Russian NPC is either unwilling or unable to uphold the IPC anti-doping code, which is in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency code, so that is what they have to respond to.""
Canadian law professor Richard McLaren's report, published last week, claimed Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015.
The IPC said it acted after McLaren provided the names of the athletes associated with the 35 ""disappearing positive samples"" from the Moscow laboratory highlighted in the report.
Nineteen samples potentially doctored as part of the sample-swapping regime during the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games have been sent for further analysis.

31,"The destination of a stimulus package worth nearly £39m was agreed as part of the Welsh government's budget deal with the Liberal Democrats.
Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it would help ""generate immediate benefits"" for the economy.
But Plaid Cymru said it was ""completely inadequate"" and the Conservatives said it should go to council tax payers.
Labour and the Lib Dems announced a budget deal on Friday night, ending weeks of negotiations between ministers and opposition parties.
With 30 of the assembly's 60 seats, Labour needs the help of at least one other party to approve its spending plans.
The £38.9m windfall - to be spent over two years - also formed part of budget discussions.
The money is coming down from the Treasury as a result of a council tax freeze in England.
A programme to help businesses hire young recruits is among projects receiving funding. The government said an extra £4.9m would create 1,800 more apprenticeships.
Some £9m will go towards upgrading school buildings, with the same amount spent on delivering an additional 130 homes.
The government will spend £3.5 improving roads in places where it is planning to create enterprise zones. Five parts of Wales have been earmarked as zones where businesses will get help to grow.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that copying the UK government by using the money to keep down council tax would not significantly benefit the economy, adding that tax bills for band D homes were lower on average in Wales.
Labour has faced criticism from opponents, particularly Plaid Cymru, for not doing enough to respond to a deteriorating economic situation.
Ms Hutt pointed to other government spending commitments, intended to help growth.
She said she had considered proposals to spend the money from across the government.
She said: ""This package builds on those actions to boost the economy and develop public services, generating immediate benefits for our economy while complementing our long term aims.""
Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies said he was disappointed ministers were using additional resources to ""top up"" existing policies.
He said: ""There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy, while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves.""
Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said her party will also work with the government on how to spend any money allocated to Wales as a result of Tuesday's Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne.
""The Welsh Liberal Democrats approach will be to continue to get our economy moving and improve the quality of life for people in Wales,"" she said.
Plaid Cymru economy spokesman Alun Ffred Jones said: ""For over six months, Labour has sat back and done nothing - exposing Wales to the full force of this economic crisis.
""Now, they're trying desperately to create the impression that this small sum of money will do what's needed. Quite simply, it will not.""",Funding to improve school buildings and create apprenticeships has been announced to help revive the economy.

And he said the costs of leaving would be ""substantial"" and ""unpalatable"".
Downing Street said the government was determined to make a success of the UK's departure from the EU.
Conservative former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said it was a ""peculiar speech in the sense that it looked backwards the whole time"".
He told BBC Newsnight: ""It was almost like a re-fight of the referendum... strangely bitter really, and almost really the speech of someone who simply refuses to accept that the British people should have made a decision such as they did.""
Prime Minister Theresa May plans to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins two years of formal negotiations, by the end of March.
She has already confirmed the UK will not remain a member of the EU single market but will instead seek a new free trade deal with the remaining members.
In a speech in London, Sir John, who campaigned for a Remain vote in June's referendum, claimed there was ""little chance"" the advantages of being part of the EU single market could be replicated once the UK leaves.
""I have watched with growing concern as the British people have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic,"" he said.
""Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery.""
For Theresa May, also an unflashy leader who was propelled to No 10 by a surprising political moment, Europe will be defining in a way no others could even have anticipated.
In Sir John's carefully calibrated speech, there are plenty of messages for her, some of which may be welcome, some not.
First off, having campaigned to stay in the European Union, with sober warnings particularly about the consequences for the Northern Irish peace process, it's no surprise that Sir John says that in his view, Brexit will be a ""historic mistake"".
It is notable, although again not surprising, that he cautions that the UK will be a diminished diplomatic force in the world after we walk away from the EU, with a warning too that we will be less useful to our most important ally, the US, as a consequence.
Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe.
What may be harder for No 10 to dismiss is Sir John's obvious political concern about how the public is being treated in the months after the referendum decision.

Sir John said Brexit talks require ""statesmanship of a high order"" and warned of a ""real risk"" of the exit deal falling ""well below the hopes and expectations"" that have been raised, saying he doubted the ""rosy confidence being offered to the British people"".
""In my own experience, the most successful results are obtained when talks are conducted with goodwill: it is much easier to reach agreement with a friend than a quarrelsome neighbour.
""Behind the diplomatic civilities, the atmosphere is already sour. A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests.""
He also said the ""cheerleaders"" for Brexit had shown a ""disregard that amounts to contempt"" towards those that backed the losing side.
And he said the UK would become ""far more dependent"" on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as ""less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors"".
Sir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that ""uncertainties over border restrictions"" after Brexit were ""a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South"".
The ex-PM, who faced battles with Eurosceptic MPs during his time in Downing Street, also said Mrs May would have to ""face down"" people calling for ""total disengagement"" from Europe.
But the Leave Means Leave campaign hit back, recalling Sir John's famous ""don't bind my hands"" plea to Tory Eurosceptics ahead of EU talks and saying he was now ""seeking to do just this to the British prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU"".
Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: ""It was a craven and defeated speech of a bitter man who was heavily defeated by the electorate for his own failings in Europe in 1997, was defeated again last June and now wishes to take out his failures on Mrs May.""","Britons are being offered an ""unreal and over-optimistic"" vision of what Brexit will look like, Sir John Major has warned."
33,"Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Labour - which is opposing the cap - was ""in denial"" over the state of the economy.
But Labour argued the cap would be a ""hit and run"" on working families.
Benefits have historically risen in line with the rate of inflation. The Commons vote is due at 19:00 GMT.
The House of Commons is debating the Welfare Benefits Uprating Bill, which would keep benefit rises to 1% for three years from next April.
The coalition argues this is necessary to reduce the deficit, and is fair at a time when public sector pay is being capped and salaries in the private sector are rising below the rate of inflation.
But Labour, which opposes the cap, says it will result in a real-terms cut in support for millions of working people.
Some Lib Dem MPs, including David Ward, John Leech, Julian Huppert and former minister Sarah Teather, are expected to rebel against the government while others - including Julian Huppert - could abstain.
Mr Leech, MP for Manchester Withington, said he found it ""objectionable that the Tories are using 'skivers versus strivers' rhetoric to justify a cut to seven million working families"".
Despite the concerns of some Lib Dems, the coalition is thought likely to win the vote.
Legislation is needed to implement changes announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last month's Autumn Statement - to cap increases in jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and elements of housing benefit.
The cap would also apply to maternity allowance, sick pay, maternity pay and paternity pay as well as the couple and lone parent elements of the working tax credit and the child element of the child tax credit.
These benefits traditionally rise in line with consumer prices in an annual process known as ""uprating"".
By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News
Glance at the spreadsheets and the scale of the saving is apparent.
Figures in the Autumn Statement show raising many benefits and tax credits by 1% a year will save £2.8bn in 2015/16, compared with the government's previous plans.
The overall welfare budget in 2011/12, as calculated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is £201bn.
The political debate will centre on who should feel the pain.
Jobseekers Allowance totals 2.4% of the total bill, according to the IFS. Benefits for those on low incomes make up just under 21%.
Those for elderly people, including the state pension, make up over 42%.
The estimated value of fraud and error overpayments in benefit expenditure in 2011-12 is £3.2 billion.
They increased 5.2% this year and without the planned change would have been set to rise by 2.2% - the rate of CPI inflation last September, on which the figure is calculated. The rate of inflation has since risen to 2.7%.
During lively scenes in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said: ""The number one priority now is reducing the deficit that they [Labour] left us - the biggest deficit since the Second World War.""
He added that the gap between the rate of income inflation between workers and the unemployed had ""grown"" in the last few years.
""These are decisions that we are not taking easily but these are circumstances that they [Labour] are in denial about,"" Mr Duncan Smith said.
For Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne accused the government of presiding over an increase in unemployment.
But Mr Duncan Smith said this was not the case and that the US and other European countries were faring worse than the UK.
Mr Byrne said the government was showing ""contempt"" by trying to ""ram this bill through the House in just one day"".
He added: ""It's turning into a hit-and-run on working families and we should not stand for it.""
Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: ""Isn't the truth of this that it's a mean and miserable piece of legislation from a mean and miserable government?""
Sarah Teather, who was replaced as an education minister in last autumn's government reshuffle, said she would oppose the bill ""with a heavy heart"" because it was ""disingenuous"" to try to ""find someone to blame for our own woes"".
""A fissure already exists between the working and non-working poor,"" she told MPs. ""Hammering on that fault line with the language of 'shirkers and strivers' will have long-term impacts on public attitudes, on attitudes of one neighbour against another.
""It will make society less generous, less sympathetic, less able to co-operate.""
However, Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes told the House: ""It's difficult but the government has got the right and I believe, after this parliament, it will be vindicated by getting more people in work and fewer out of work.""
David Cameron's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister's view is that the welfare system has to be brought back under control. The measures that the government has been taking, ever since the government came to power, have been designed to that end.""
The BBC's political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said an ""impact assessment"" published by the government suggested single parents would be most affected by the cap - losing £5 a week or about £250 over the three year period.
The majority of working age households in receipt of state support are likely be an average of £3 a week worse off.","The government has urged MPs to back a 1% cap on annual rises in working-age benefits and some tax credits, arguing it is vital to cutting the deficit."
34,"Network Rail and Thames Water engineers are at the scene after the hole appeared in Forest Hill on Monday.
The disruption is expected to last until Wednesday, with Southern, Thameslink and London Overground services affected.
Thames Water said a sewer under the track had collapsed.
It said the repair work was ""extremely complex"" and that engineers had located the problem section of the sewer and were working to seal it.
Dry concrete has been put into the hole, forming a base to pour wet concrete on top. Once it has set, about 50 tonnes of ballast will be inserted, with the aim of opening the railway on Wednesday.
Network Rail has closed all four lines between East Croydon and London Bridge, meaning Southern services to London Bridge are either cancelled or diverted.
London Overground services are not running between West Croydon/Crystal Palace and New Cross Gate.
Carl Leadbetter, Thames Water's regional network manager, said: ""Our teams continue to work as fast as possible on this critical job.
""While we need to work quickly to reopen the train lines, we also need to consider local residents, who will potentially suffer from sewer flooding if the pipe is not properly enclosed.
""This is an extremely complex job as the pipe is in a difficult location in the tracks and six metres below the ground.""
Network Rail apologised for the delays and said it was working ""as hard as possible"" to get the problem fixed by Wednesday morning's rush hour.
Spokesman Chris Denham said the hole ""couldn't be in a worse place"".
""This is a massive piece of railway,"" he told BBC Radio London. ""It's the equivalent of shutting the A2 out of London in the morning. It's absolutely huge.""
Some passengers expressed their frustration on social media, mentioning how the problem occurred on the hottest day of the year so far.
Elsewhere in London, high temperatures have been disrupting trains between the city and the West, with speeds being cut over fears of rails buckling.
Trains coming out of Paddington, Euston and Liverpool Street all saw severe disruption.
And Southern services heading to Brighton from Victoria were heavily disrupted following a track failure in the Gatwick area.
It comes as commuters have experienced months of cancellations and delays on Southern trains due to an RMT dispute.
New rail minister Paul Maynard will appear before the Commons Transport Select Committee on Wednesday to give evidence on the Department for Transport's role in the issue.

35,"Everton had won on their last four visits to City - and for an hour frustration was in the air again as they mounted a wall of well-organised resistance that kept Roberto Mancini's side at bay.
The introduction of substitute Mario Balotelli on the hour led to the breakthrough as he scored with a deflected shot after 68 minutes and finally unsettled Everton with an impressive cameo.
It was the type of result and performances that adds weight to the argument that City will mount a serious title challenge this season

James Milner, another second-half substitute, added the second with two minutes left from David Silva's sublime pass to allow City to move top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester United's visit to Stoke City.
And it was a win City deserved for demonstrating the patience and persistence they will need as Everton's dour approach is likely to be mirrored by plenty of sides who will attempt to suppress City's wide range of attacking options at Etihad Stadium.

Everton's tactics appeared designed to secure a draw and perhaps aim to take an isolated chance on the break.
But David Moyes' side were undermined by a failure to offer anything in attack, although substitute Louis Saha - and his manager - were rightly infuriated when referee Howard Webb failed to award a free-kick when he was blatantly fouled on the edge of the area by Vincent Kompany with the game still in the balance.
Moyes also believed Everton had been the victims of injustice in the build-up to Balotelli's crucial goal, claiming City were wrongly awarded a throw in.
Mancini will relish the manner of this win as much as other victories earned in real style this season. Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.
Everton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.
Moyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva.
Sergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar.
It was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence. Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction.
Balotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner.

The visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten.
Balotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.
Silva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left. Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard.
Everton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.

36,"Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs a target to reduce six week delays in discharging patients had been delivered.
But Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record.
Ms Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past.
Delayed discharge - sometimes referred to as bed blocking - is when a patient is not released from hospital despite being clinically well enough to be discharged, often because of a lack of care of care services.
Ms Sturgeon faced criticism over the issue during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale saying that people had remained in hospital for a total of 612,000 days last year when they were well enough to go home.
She said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to.
Ms Dugdale added: ""That means it has more than trebled under the SNP government since this first minister admitted there was something badly wrong. So, by any measure that is unacceptable.
""That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.""
She also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to ""completely eradicate"" the problem.
The substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.""
A delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.
Dr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.
According to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed ""zero delays over six weeks"" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.
The immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.
Dr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.

Ms Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said ""real progress"" was being made.
She later added: ""Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.
""Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.""
That comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.
Dr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.
He also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.
Dr Simpson added: ""We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.
""Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.
""Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.""
But a Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.
""Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.
""Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.""",Labour has accused the Scottish first minister of misleading parliament over hospital bed blocking statistics.
37,"Overflow pipes at the Burry Inlet near Llanelli are used to help stop flooding.
But the European Court of Justice ruled this broke clean water laws in a special conservation area.
The Welsh Government, Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water said they were investing in improvements.
Though the UK has not been fined, it will have to pay legal costs in a case that also found a number of other breaches around the handling of waste water in England and Gibraltar.
The problems stem from the UK's ageing Victorian sewers, engineering marvels of their time, but now out of date.
The pipes were designed to mix both sewage and rainwater but over the years new housing developments and more frequent storms as a result of climate change have put pressure on the system.
Welsh Water has 3,000 special overflow pipes which act as relief valves to deal with the extra sewage and rainwater but go straight into rivers and the sea.
At the Burry Inlet there are 14 overflow pipes which discharge into an area supposed to be protected by UK and EU laws.
It includes salt marshes and is a habitat for tens of thousands of wild birds during the winter.
2,200
hectares of saltmarsh - largest continuous area in Wales
20,000 waterfowl are supported
13,590  oystercatchers
35,000  wildbirds spend winter including curlew, godwit and shelduck
The local cockling industry has also been hit but Welsh Water insisted this was not due to their discharges.
It is investing in a Â£113m project to reduce the number of spills.
RainScape involves reducing the amount of water that reaches the sewers through planting green spaces on streets and roofs to absorb rain and building channels to capture surface water.
The UK argued the improvements would mean it could comply with EU clean water laws by 2020.
However, the ECJ - which rules on disputes involving EU legislation - found the UK had acted ""too late"" and was failing in its obligations.
Judges ruled spills contributed to the deterioration of water quality in the Loughor Estuary.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We will continue to work with Natural Resources Wales and Dwr Cymru on a Â£113m programme to reduce the number of spills, improve water quality and reduce the risk of local flooding by 2020.""
Welsh Water added: ""We have met the legal permits for water quality in the Loughor estuary and are aware of ever increasing environmental standards and the need to manage long-term challenges, such as climate change, in a truly sustainable away.""
The UK Government said all sites in England included in the judgement ""now comply with the directive and plans are in place elsewhere across the UK to deliver compliance by 2020 at the latest"".",The UK has been found to be in breach of EU laws over the amount of sewage and waste water discharged into the sea off Carmarthenshire.
38,"He also hailed improving ties between the US and Cuba as ""an example of reconciliation for the whole world"".
The Pope was greeted by President Raul Castro after landing in the capital, Havana.
The Pope is due to celebrate Mass on Sunday in Havana's iconic Revolution Square.
He will spend four days in Cuba before flying to the US.
Following his arrival on Cuba on Saturday, thousands lined the route of the Pope's motorcade to the home of the Vatican's ambassador to Cuba.
Pope Francis - the first pontiff to hail from Latin America  - is credited with helping the recent thaw in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US.
Mr Castro has thanked the Pope for his contribution.
Speaking at the airport alongside President Castro, Pope Francis urged further support for Cuba's Catholics ""so that the Church can continue to support and encourage the Cuban people in its hopes and concerns, with the freedom, the means and the space needed to bring the proclamation of the kingdom to the existential peripheries of society"".
He also called on Cuba and the US to ""persevere on the path"" of detente.
On Thursday the Vatican said it hoped the Pope's visit would help bring an end to the 53-year-old US embargo and lead to more freedom and human rights on the island.
Pensioner Diego Carrera told AP the visit was ""like a breath of hope blowing over Cuba"" because of the role that the Pope played in the reestablishment of relations with the US.
On Friday the US announced eased restrictions on business and travel with Communist Cuba, the latest move by President Barack Obama to improve relations.
At the scene: Will Grant, BBC News, Havana
Disembarking to chants of ""Christ lives"" and other religious slogans, the Pope was welcomed off the plane by Raul Castro. He was quick to praise the pontiff for his leadership on issues of climate change and poverty and thanked him for his role in brokering talks with Washington.
The Pope said he was in Cuba to ""support and encourage the Cuban people in their hopes and concerns"". While he didn't shy away from using the word ""freedom"" in his initial address, he is still unlikely to publically berate the Cuban government over its human rights record - choosing instead a more pragmatic approach.
As the first Latin American pope, he's likely to receive a unique welcome from the Cuban people - many of whom remember when a commitment to atheism was a key part of the constitution.
Cuba all set for Pope Francis
Cristina Fernandez Kirchner, president of the Pope's native Argentina, also arrived on the island on Saturday and will attend the Mass in Revolution Square.
Workers have been building a huge altar and stands for the congregation and choir on the square.
Streets have been newly paved in Havana, and the cathedral has been renovated.
In the city of Holguin where the Pope will celebrate Mass on Monday, the cathedral has been repaired and repainted.
Nearly 1,000 Cuban and foreign journalists were expected to cover the visit.
In 1998 Pope John Paul II became the first Pope to visit the island, saying: ""May Cuba... open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba.""
His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, also visited Cuba in 2012.
Francis's trip will later take him to the US, which he will also be visiting for the first time since his election to the papacy.","Pope Francis has called for the Church in Cuba to have ""the freedom and the means"" to pursue its mission, on his first visit to the island."

Oliver, who has worked with Smith during that whole period, said: ""Back then, we could not have imagined we would have won global qualifying events, played in world cups at youth and senior level, played One Day International games in front of thousands, run a fully professional national team as well as winning numerous development awards at a European and Global level.
""I and all at Cricket Scotland wish Roddy every success in his next role.""
Cricket Scotland will start the recruitment process to find Smith's successor with the aim of having a replacement in place early in the new year.

41,"But the Premier League club say they want Allardyce to stay, insisting he is ""very much key to our plans"".
Sunderland claim speculation about Allardyce has been ""extremely damaging"" and have urged the FA to ""bring about a swift resolution to the matter"".
England are searching for a new boss after Roy Hodgson quit on 28 June.
He resigned after the national team were knocked out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage by Iceland.
Photographs that appeared to show Allardyce, 61, at the home of FA vice-chairman David Gill were published in the media in the past 24 hours.
Allardyce had been on tour with Sunderland in Austria until he returned home at the start of the week, reportedly on transfer business.
Sunderland said they agreed to let Allardyce speak with the FA as a ""potential candidate"" after he requested permission, but are upset discussions did not remain confidential.
""After what was an extremely challenging season, we are keen to see a period of stability, both on and off the field, and we want him to remain as manager of our football club,"" read a club statement issued on Wednesday.
Kevin Davies, who played under Allardyce at Bolton, thinks his former boss would be a good choice for England.
""Where we are now as a nation, I think he is probably the right man,"" said Davies, who earned one England cap during his career.
""Motivation-wise, he is fantastic, the best I have ever worked with. He knows how to get the best out of a player.
""He has a lot of other strengths, too. He surrounds himself with the best people in the best roles, which allows him to plan and get the best out of his squad.""
Davies also thinks Allardyce will improve morale in the dressing room.
""The atmosphere he will create will be similar to Wales or Iceland... that spirit, that togetherness, along with the ability that we have a lacked,"" said Davies.
""I think he has always thrived on being the underdog and I think England are going to go into a lot of games as underdogs in the future, so it probably will suit the way England are at the moment. ""
Allardyce is not the only Premier League manager linked with the England job.
Arsenal's Arsene Wenger, Bournemouth's Eddie Howe and Hull City's Steve Bruce have all been touted as possible candidates.
United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann and former England manager Glenn Hoddle have also been linked with the job, but Allardyce is the frontrunner.
The former West Ham, Newcastle, Bolton and Blackburn boss, who has one year left on his Sunderland contract, won a lot of plaudits for keeping the Black Cats in the Premier League last season.

The England manager will be chosen by a three-man panel - Gill, FA technical director Dan Ashworth and chief executive Martin Glenn.
They want the next boss to be a strong-minded, tactically savvy manager who will build a clear team identity and help shape the team into a cohesive unit.
Allardyce was previously interviewed for the role in 2006 after Sven-Goran Eriksson left following that year's World Cup.
Eriksson's assistant Steve McClaren got the job instead but he failed to guide England to qualification for the 2008 European Championship.
Here's what Allardyce has since said about the England job:
2009
After missing out to McClaren:
""I should have got it and I really don't know why I didn't. It had to be political for me, rather than my credentials.
""Maybe my external look isn't to everybody's liking. It was the right time and the right job for me but not from the FA's point of view.
""It seems foreign coaches are still all the craze for the top jobs and that is a great shame. I also think that Steve not being successful was a massive blow for British or English managers, because it has put us down a peg or two.""
2015
From his autobiography:
""I wanted to do a real knock-your-socks-off interview for the FA, so I put together a PowerPoint which looked at every single detail.
""Nobody but nobody was going to beat it. But then Brian Barwick, the chief executive, told me there were no PowerPoint facilities at the interview venue, so I had to print off hard copies for the panel. So much for the progressive FA.
""I should have got it and, as I'm a better manager now than I was then, I believe I should be in the running whenever it comes round again. That's not vanity or being full of my own importance. My track record entitles me to be considered.""
May 2016
Prior to Euro 2016:
""That's gone. For me to be interested in the England job, Roy would probably have to leave at the end of the Euros.
""And would England be interested in me? They say they are looking for an English manager, but will they do it?

And while Howley would be pleased with the improvement in Wales' performance, a lack of composure in attack, particularly when they were on top in the first half, will be a concern.
Wales controlled the opening period but, apart from two penalties by Halfpenny, had little to show for their dominance at the break as Argentina repeatedly infringed in their own 22.
When referee Angus Gardner finally lost patience and sent prop Ramiro Herrera to the sin-bin with a minute of the first half remaining, Wales were promptly penalised at the next scrum and went in with a three-point lead which barely reflected the run of play.

After the break, wing Williams produced a tenacious finish to edge Wales eight points clear before Landajo's opportunism from a quick penalty created a try for the superb Hernandez.
When Davies dummied over for his eighth international try and Halfpenny converted, it looked as though Wales would pull clear.
But the Pumas, with Sanchez a probing threat at fly-half, hit back again when Landajo was given the benefit of the doubt by television official Sean Davey.
An exchange of penalties meant Wales led by a point before Halfpenny eased the nerves with his fifth successful kick of the game.

43,"The 130m-tall (420ft) Bulford Kiwi, on Bulford Hill near Stonehenge, was carved by New Zealand troops who were stationed there.
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made it a scheduled monument on the advice of Historic England.
Kiwi soldiers played a significant role in the Battle of Messines, fought in June 1917 in Belgium.
Another monument at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, marking the same battle, has also been granted protection.
The Terrain Model of Messines - a scale model of the battlefield - was made by German prisoners of war using soil, concrete, bricks and pebbles.
The model was a popular tourist attraction at the end of the war, but it became neglected and was lost until it was recently excavated.
It has now been covered over again to protect it from damage and erosion.
Roger Bowdler from Historic England said: ""These two monuments pay tribute to the bravery of New Zealand's fighting forces in the First World War and we are delighted that they are now being protected for the future.
""The Bulford Kiwi was cut into the chalk at the end of the war by Kiwi soldiers themselves, to mark the presence of their forces in England, and their achievements at the front.
""The taking of the Messines ridge was one of the war's most stirring attacks, and this model lay-out remains as testimony to the planning which made possible the victory.
""Like so much of our historic environment, these lasting reminders enable us to connect with lives and events from the past that made us who we are as a nation.
""One hundred years on, it is right to remember New Zealand's valour.""
Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK said: ""It's fantastic to see Historic England protecting two very significant sites of huge importance for New Zealand.
""The special connections that were forged 100 years ago, with communities in the UK where New Zealanders trained, are still strong today and it's moving to see these sites protected for generations to come.""",A giant chalk carving of a kiwi has been granted protected status on the centenary of a World War One battle.
44,"An internal prison report seen by the BBC says the the inmate ran down a landing with the keys at HMP Wayland.
""As he was being restrained another prisoner attempted to grab another officer's keys,"" the report adds.
A Prison Service spokesman said both men had been transferred to a higher security jail.
They also face additional time added to their sentences.
Both men were ""quickly apprehended"" during the incident on A wing at about 09:00 BST on 27 May, the report states.
Wayland, near Watton in Norfok, is a Category C men's prison with just over 1,000 inmates.","An inmate at a prison grabbed keys from an officer and, while he was being restrained, a second prisoner tried to take another set of keys."
45,"If he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous.
I cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.
Of course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.
When I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.
Character is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.
At 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.
We had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.
They were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.
For Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.
He always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.
He comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.
So it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.
At times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.
These days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.
Tim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.
Villa have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.
But, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.
You have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.
Villa's net spend over the summer was under £10m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.
They have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.
I don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.
You cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.
I get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.
Sherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.
The choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.
Like Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.
In an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.
But what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.
Sherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.
Whoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.
Because he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.
Grealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.
However good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.
When you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.
You really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.
That might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.
After trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.
A settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.
Chris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",There is a lot of talk that Tim Sherwood is close to being sacked by Aston Villa but I cannot understand why they would even contemplate getting rid of him at this stage of the season.

47,"Figures show that for those aged 65, men can expect to live for another 19 years and women a further 21 years.
But there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health.
And the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions.
Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013.
Female life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages.
This comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012.
The only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013.
Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease.
In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important.
Prof John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving ""a good quality of life in later years even more important"".
""This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health,"" he said.
""Most of us could make changes today, like stopping smoking, being more active or eating better, that would allow us to look forward to healthier later years.""
He said it was not clear what had caused the variation in trends between local areas.
Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, said there was an urgent need to find out why improvements had stalled in many parts of England in recent years.
""Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country,"" he said.
In Scotland, life expectancy continued to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live for a further 17.4 years and women a further 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics.
But there are also wide variations across the country.","Older people in England are living longer than ever before, a report from Public Health England says."

51,"Mr Menezes, an electrician who was fatally shot at Stockwell Tube station in south London on 22 July 2005 by officers who mistook him for a suicide bomber, arrived in the UK from Brazil in 2002.
He had joined an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Brazilians - including some relatives - in London and quickly learnt to speak English.
The son of bricklayer Matosinhos Otoni da Silva, Mr Menezes was born in the town of Gonzaga in the state of Minas Gerais - a source of many migrants to Europe and the US.
He spent his childhood living in an adobe hut in the town.
Mr Silva told BBC News his son had always wanted to be an electrician - as a child, he would make electrical toys with batteries, copper and matchboxes.
Mr Menezes moved to Sao Paulo to live with his uncle at the age of 14, attended high school and became a qualified electrician.
His father said Mr Menezes had always had a desire to move abroad to earn money.
""When he was a child he said: 'Father, I heard on the radio people make good money in England, the United States, France. If I have money to go, I will go. I will take advantage of my age and my energy to help you out.'""
About half of the young people from Gonzaga move abroad in the hope of securing a better future.
The Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002.
He then applied for leave to remain as a student, which was approved. He was granted leave to remain until 30 June 2003.
The Home Office says his visa expired at that time and that he remained illegally in the UK until his death.
Like many Brazilians in London, Mr Menezes would send money home to his parent's modest farm in Gonzaga.
""He didn't make a lot of money,"" his father said. ""Most of his money went on rent and food.
""He wanted to stay for another two years to save money so he could come back and invest in a ranch.""
He said his son was happy in London.
Friends say Mr Menezes was as shocked as all Londoners by the 7 July 2005 Tube and bus bombings, as well as the attempted London public transport attacks on Thursday 21 July - the day before he was shot.
Gésio César D'avila, a friend and colleague, said Mr Menezes had considered alternative transport after the failed attacks.
""We were together on Thursday, and when we saw what happened, Jean said he wanted to buy a motorbike to avoid the Tube,"" he said.
On 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived.
They believed Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21 July bombers, was living there. What they did not immediately realise was that the flats shared a communal entrance.
It is thought Mr Menezes left his flat, which he shared with cousins Vivian and Patricia, in order to fit a fire alarm.
Undercover police officers began following Mr Menezes because they thought he looked like Osman.
He took a bus to Stockwell station, where he boarded a train. There he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder by two officers trained in stopping suicide bombers.
Police were later to say the officers had feared for their own lives and for those of other passengers on the train.
In the days that followed the shooting, a makeshift memorial to Mr Menezes was set up outside Stockwell Tube station.  The shrine of flowers, candles, pictures and newspaper articles became a gathering point for campaigners seeking answers over the incident.
Almost a year after his death, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no officers would be prosecuted, but the Met Police would be tried for breaching health and safety laws.
On 1 November 2007, the force was found guilty at the Old Bailey of endangering the public over the operation that led to the shooting and fined £175,000 with £385,000 costs. A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times
An inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts.
The Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed.
In January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial. A colourful mosaic framing a photograph of Mr Menezes was created by local artist Mary Edwards.","Nearly a decade after the police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, his family have brought a case at the European Court of Human Rights in an attempt to see someone prosecuted over the 27-year-old's killing."
52,"Glasgow City Council said it planned to put up the tax by 3% after the national council tax freeze ended this year.
Council leader Frank McAveety said while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m.
Most councils have yet to confirm plans, with about a third indicating they may propose a 3% increase.
Further details of Glasgow's budget proposals are expected later.
Mr McAveety said: ""Raising Council Tax will support frontline services while protecting the most vulnerable in our city.
""One-in-four households will not pay a penny more - and we can avoid around £7m of the most difficult cuts, which would otherwise hit every community across the city.""
The average bill in the city - in the Band D category - is £1,213, compared to the national average of £1,149. All other bills are a set proportion of this figure.
But changes this year mean those in bands E, F, G and H properties will automatically pay more - even before the 3% across-the-board rise is factored in.
Increases are due to take effect just weeks before May's council elections.
BBC Scotland's local government correspondent Jamie McIvor said: ""Inevitably, close attention will be paid to decisions taken by councils in the west of Scotland where the SNP is hoping to make big inroads into Labour's council powerbase.
""Privately, some Labour councillors believe they are caught between a rock and a hard place.
""They argue a rise in council tax would merely limit cuts rather than end them, so they would risk asking voters to 'pay more and get less'.
""However, they also believe that if they did not raise the council tax, they would be accused of failing to use the means at their disposal to at least attempt to mitigate cuts.""
Labour-run South Lanarkshire has said it plans to freeze bills this year but the leader of West Dunbartonshire Council has indicated a rise is likely.

He insists he was the rightful winner of the polls, but Uganda's top court upheld the official result.
""We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason,"" said his lawyer Erias Lukwago.
Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since.
It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr Museveni was sworn in on Thursday for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda.
Foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation.
In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence.
Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission ""lacked independence and transparency"", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that ""those Europeans are not serious"".
""Transparency is what we've been voting for,"" he added.
Mr Museveni, a key ally of the West in the campaign against militant Islamists in the region, seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda.
However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.

""We've spoken a lot about momentum these past few weeks, and that could be huge for us now heading into the second Test next week.""
The Wallabies were leading 7-3 through Israel Folau's converted before the Lions hit back with a fine individual try from North.
The 21-year-old, making his Lions Test debut, effortlessly beat three players during a 60-metre run before crossing for his third try of the tour.
""When the ball dropped out of the sky, my first thought was just to run,"" said North.
""Luckily, I saw a gap and I just went for it. It opened up for me, and I can't begin to tell you how good it felt when I crossed that line.""
North, who has joined Northampton Saints from Scarlets ahead of the 2013-14 season, thought he had struck again just five minutes later when he squeezed over in the corner.
But the television match official ruled a combination of opposite number Israel Folau getting a hand underneath the ball and the Lions wing's free arm hitting the touchline meant no try.
""I felt it was a try. At the end of the day, the TMO makes his call and you have to live with it. But I certainly felt that I had got there,"" North added.
""Perhaps one or two things didn't quite go for us in that regard today, so it makes the win even better.""
The Lions face Melbourne Rebels, led by former Wales number eight Gareth Delve, on Tuesday before next Saturday's second Test against the Wallabies in the same city.
Victory at Melbourne's Etihad Stadium would secure a first Lions Test series win since 1997 but North believes there is room for improvement.
""I definitely think we can play a lot better than we did,"" North added.
""We need to be more clinical, and we need to get a bit more accuracy in our game.
""It's a funny one, really. We know we can play better than that, but we are obviously still delighted to get the win.
""That wasn't our best performance, and we need to keep pushing for next week.""

Mr Lauber also said he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation.
The allegations centre on a payment made to Mr Platini in 2011 at Fifa's expense for work he completed almost a decade earlier.
It came just two months before Uefa gave its backing to Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, leading some to question the timing of it.
Mr Platini said he was told when starting the work that Fifa would not be able to pay him all the money because of its ""financial situation"".
But Fifa accounts show a revenue surplus of around $83m (Â£55m) from 1999-2002, when Mr Platini undertook the work as a technical adviser.
Fifa was thrown into turmoil this year when the US and Swiss authorities launched separate investigations into corruption at the body.
Mr Blatter is also suspected of signing a contract that was ""unfavourable to Fifa"". He is due to stand down next year, but says he will carry on in the role despite the criminal proceedings.","Michel Platini, the head of European football's governing body Uefa, is being treated as ""in between a witness and an accused person'' by Swiss prosecutors investigating corruption at the world football authority Fifa."
58,"The 41-year-old reached the semi-final for the first time since he last lifted the trophy in 2011 with a 13-6 win over Kyren Wilson.
The world number six will now face the winner of Stephen Maguire's match against Barry Hawkins for a place in Sunday's final.
""I believe I can [win], and that's a great feeling to have,"" Higgins said.
""I was close last year, Alan [McManus] pipped me [in the quarter-final],"" he added.
""A couple of years after 2011, I'd been losing, my form wasn't great and you don't think you're going to get back to that one-table set up.
""It's the best place in the world to get out and play and I can't wait to get into the arena tomorrow [Thursday]. I'm buzzing.""
Higgins won all three sessions against Wilson, the world number 16, and believes his game has grown in strength over the course of the tournament.
The Scot considers reigning champion Mark Selby as the favourite for the title, while his pre-competition tip was Hawkins. Yet Higgins is in a good place mentally as he prepares for the semi-final.
""The nerves get more difficult, but I'm more relaxed this year,"" he said.

""I don't know if that's because I feel as if I'm playing OK. At this event, you need to have a few sessions when you have good, frame-winning breaks. I did that against Mark Allen and in the second session against Kyren.
""To win this event you need a couple of sessions when you're dominating the other player. I feel as if my game can be there to do that but I'm sure other players will say the same thing.
""There are some sessions, especially this year, when I couldn't have played any better. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better. You've just got to hope that comes out in the big matches.""
Maguire was once tipped as a potential world champion by O'Sullivan, and Hawkins said the Scot is benefitting from curbing his socialising at tournaments.
Higgins would like to face his compatriot Maguire in the semi-final, because it would guarantee that a Scot will feature in Sunday's final.
""Everybody's got their own choices in life and us Scots, we maybe like a drink and there's nothing wrong with that,"" Higgins said. ""Life's too short.
""Stephen is a great player and I hope [he] comes through. If he was to beat me, I would be the first one to cheer him to win his first world title.
""But I get on well with Barry as well and I know how difficult he is to beat. In the last few years he's grown into a great champion, because he always had the game and he's got the belief now.""",John Higgins believes he has the ability and the form to win his fifth World Championship.
59,"Pte Paul Wilkinson said he asked Pte Cheryl James to choose one of her lovers and pick him or her boyfriend.
The inquest in Woking was told Pte Wilkinson and Pte James had been caught in bed by her boyfriend Sapper Simeon Carr-Minns, known then as Jim.
Pte James was found dead with a bullet wound to the head in November 1995.
The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was one of four recruits to die at the base in seven years.
Mr Wilkinson, then aged 16, said he spoke to Pte James about 20 minutes before he heard she had died.
He said: ""I just remember saying 'pick one of us, if you want to be friends that would be fine if you want to stay with him'. She said that she did not.""
Mr Wilkinson said he did not try to avoid being seen while the pair talked and he was just sitting in a chair in the cabin while she was on guard duty.
He was eventually seen by a major and told to leave because he should not have been with Pte James while she was on duty, the inquest heard.
He said the officer ""pretty much escorted me back to the barracks"".
The major has previously told the inquest that he did not march Mr Wilkinson off.
The inquest heard that was the last time Mr Wilkinson saw Pte James.
He also told the hearing about his anger and upset after Mr Carr-Minns caught him in bed with Pte James, days before she died.
He said Pte James told him then she was splitting up with Mr Carr-Minns.
Alison Foster QC, representing the James family, suggested to Mr Wilkinson he was ""not just angry"" but ""humiliated"" when Mr Carr-Minns turned up because other people who were also in the room began to tease and laugh at him.
Mr Wilkinson said being caught in bed by her boyfriend ""is not what you want"".
Ms Foster then told Mr Wilkinson the major was certain he had not marched him away and asked: ""Were you aware that you needed to sort out some sort of alibi?""
Mr Wilkinson said he had always given the same account but the other officer remembered it differently.
Ms Foster then recalled a statement from December 2002 in which Mr Wilkinson commented that if he had not been forced off the grounds he could have been facing a murder charge and been in prison.
But Mr Wilkinson denied he had tipped Pte James over the edge.
Ms Foster took Mr Wilkinson through differences in statements he has made and said: ""Your story gets more and more elaborate as time goes by.
""Your upset and humiliation gave you a motive to be seriously angry with Cheryl.
""Is it the case you have been less than truthful for your reason for going to see her on Monday morning?""
But Mr Wilkinson replied: ""No that is not true. I have said all that I remembered.""
Mr Wilkinson was asked if he saw Pte James sitting by a tree, if either of them had messed with her rifle, if he saw an accident happen to her, if he was present when the trigger was pulled, and if he heard the shot - he replied ""no"" to each question.
He had earlier denied he got violent when angry but Ms Foster pointed out he put someone's head through an arcade machine when he thought they were laughing about Pte James's death.
Mr Wilkinson said he had been pushed to breaking point and added: ""I think any other person would have done the same thing.""
A first inquest into Pte James's death in December 1995 recorded an open verdict. This second inquest was ordered after High Court judges quashed the original findings.
The hearing continues.","A boyfriend of a young soldier who died at Deepcut barracks asked her to end a love triangle at the Surrey base on the day she died, an inquest has heard."
60,"Doug Richard, 57, allegedly paid for the girl and her 15-year-old friend to travel from Norwich in January 2015.
The jury was told he took them to a Bishopsgate flat, where he spanked the younger girl and had sex with her.
He denies sexual activity with a minor and paying a child for sex.
Mr Richard, a US citizen who lives in Islington, north London, says the sex was consensual and that he ""reasonably believed"" the girl was over 16.
He gave a total of Â£480 to the teenager and her friend, which he says was for ""travel expenses"".
Prosecutor Gino Connor told the jury how Mr Richard met the girl through a US website where he listed his profile as a ""sugar daddy"", while 13-year-old called herself a ""sugar baby"".
During an iChat exchange retrieved from his laptop, the defendant asked her for a ""revealing"" photograph on her hands and knees.
""You are my new daddy I will do anything to keep you happy,"" the girl replied.
They arranged to meet and Mr Richard made a payment of Â£120 through PayPal, the court heard.
The girls travelled to Liverpool Street station on the morning of 2 January, where they met Mr Richard in a nearby cafe.
He asked their ages and they told him they were 16 and 17, the court heard.
Police were alerted after the mother of the older girl noticed a PayPal deposit in her bank account.
An examination of the 13-year-old on 4 January indicted she had suffered an injury that could have been caused by sex.
Mr Richard was arrested the following day at the Lord Milner Hotel in Belgravia.
The court heard he reacted by saying: ""As you can see I am in a lot of trouble.""
The trial continues.","A former Dragons' Den star paid a 13-year-old girl for sex in a rented London apartment after meeting her on a ""sugar daddy"" website, the Old Bailey has heard."

""Caster Semenya is one of the contenders,"" Mutola, who won the 800m Olympic title at the 2000 Olympics, told BBC Africa.
""Pamela Jelimo from Kenya and the Russians are also very, very capable. I'm looking forward to a good final.""
Mutola, 39, set the benchmark for women's 800m running until her retirement in 2008, winning three world titles and the Olympic title in Sydney.
Semenya, who won the 800m title at the 2009 World Championships, asked her ""idol"" Mutola to be her coach at the end of last year with the sole purpose of helping her win Olympic gold.
The 21-year-old looked comfortable in the semi-finals, producing a burst of speed down the back straight to move to the front of the pack and take the line two metres clear of her rivals.
""In 800m you need to be able to run a fast race, and you need to be able to win a tactical slow race,"" explained Mutola, who is in London to fine-tune Semenya's preparations.
""You [need to] combine those two things - so if the race is slow you can win anyway and if the race is fast then it's even better, [as in] the final they'll have to dip under two minutes.
""Since I've got here I've focused more on my athlete Caster Semenya as I know she has to do well, so I'm just enjoying being a coach for the first time.""
Semenya became global news when she was asked to take a gender test by athletics' governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations in the aftermath of winning her world title.
Doubts were raised over her gender because of her muscular physique, running style and sudden improvement in times.

63,"According to AP, the lawsuits accuse them of serious safety lapses.
Rashad Charjuan Owens has been in jail on murder charges since March after four people died when his car broke through a barrier at the music, film and interactive festival.
The crash, which happened outside the Mohawk venue, also injured 23 people.
Among several wrongful deaths lawsuits was one from the family of Steven Craenmehr, a Dutch music executive, who was knocked off his bike.
His widow and mother claim that SXSW organisers didn't put enough traffic safeguards on the roads for pedestrians during the event, which sees thousands of bands performing at venues across Austin.
""A festival organiser or traffic design consultant of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger,"" the lawsuit says.
Lawyers for SXSW released a statement which read: ""What happened on Red River was a terrible tragedy, caused by Rashad Owen's utter disregard of human life.
""Our hearts continue to ache for those injured and the families of those who lost their lives.
""We look forward to his prosecution for his awful crimes.""
Authorities say that Owens drove his grey Honda Civic through a barricade after an officer on a drink-drive patrol tried stopping the car.
According to police, his blood alcohol level was .114, above Texas' legal driving limit of .08.
In September, a SXSW safety report found that alcohol consumption and overcrowded venues during the event had left Austin facing a ""critical point where public safety could be compromised"" if changes are not made.
Organisers called the report incomplete and said it failed to address root issues.

It also plans to increase the ethylene capacity of its crackers at Grangemouth in Scotland and Rafnes in Norway.
Both rely on fracked shale gas being shipped across to Europe from the US.
Ethylene and propylene are key building blocks in the manufacture of plastics.
In a statement, Ineos said its investment would boost the amount of ethylene it can produce at each plant in Grangemouth and Rafnes by about 50%, to more than one million tonnes.
About 150 new jobs are expected to be created at each location, once the expansion of processing units is completed in three to four years' time.

67,"His departure was said to be one recommendation of a report  by former US Attorney-General Eric Holder about the company's culture and practices.
Uber said the board had voted unanimously to adopt all the report's recommendations.
However, its contents will not be released until Tuesday.
Mr Holder was asked to undertake the review in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler made claims of sexual harassment.
The Financial Times reported that neither Uber nor Mr Michael would comment on whether he had resigned or been fired.
James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt, said Mr Michael's departure reflected Uber's need for a ""fall guy"" and could help protect Mr Kalanick.
""If Kalanick did leave, we think it would be very difficult for him to come back,"" Mr Cakmak told Bloomberg.
It is possible Mr Kalanick could be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. That issue was on the agenda at a seven-hour board meeting held in Los Angeles on Sunday.
Mr Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother in a boating accident.
An Uber insider said the recommendations in Mr Holder's report include introducing more control on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Mr Kalanick have had an unusual degree of autonomy for a company of Uber's size.
The San Francisco-based ride-hailing service has more than 12,000 employees.
Mr Kalanick has earned a reputation as an abrasive leader and was criticised earlier this year after being caught on video berating an Uber driver.
He said in response to the video: ""I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.""
Uber board member Arianna Huffington has said Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a ""scrappy entrepreneur"" to be more like a ""leader of a major global company"".
One Uber investor said the board's decisions were a step in the right direction, giving the firm an ""opportunity to reboot"".
Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, said: ""This week we finally learn just how committed Travis Kalanick and the rest of the senior leadership team at Uber is  to meaningful cultural change.""
Last week Uber said it fired 20 staff after another law firm examined more than 200 cases including complaints about sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying.
As part of its attempt to draw a line under its recent problems, Uber said it had appointed Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive and Alibaba board member, as an independent director.
She is the third high-profile female appointment to the company in the past week.
Uber, which is still privately owned with voting control resting with Mr Kalanick and his two board allies, is valued at about $68bn. Although revenues hit $6.5bn last year, it is yet to make a profit.","Emil Michael, Uber's senior vice-president and a close ally of chief executive Travis Kalanick, has left the company, employees have been told."

69,"The title pacesetters would always be able to recover from a bad result - but how would they cope with the exclusion of their firebrand top scorer after a training ground bust-up and suggestions of interest from China?
Chelsea gave their answer with an impressive 3-0 win at Leicester City that, combined with the weekend's other results, put them firmly back in control of their Premier League destiny.
So, after 21 games and another weekend of significant matches, how are the top six clubs shaping up?
Form: Won 14 out of past 15.
Upcoming fixtures: 22 January - Hull (home), 31 January - Liverpool (away), 4 February - Arsenal (home).
Conte will have demanded an instant Premier League response from his team after that 2-0 loss at White Hart Lane, which he rightly placed in context by pointing out it was inflicted by a quality side with title aspirations of their own.
The wildcard was provided by the sudden falling out with influential striker Costa that provided an unexpected backdrop to Saturday's events at the King Power Stadium and gave the first hint of dissent in Chelsea and Conte's camp this season.
In the end, the Italian boss was given the opportunity to prove the versatility and flexibility of his squad in Costa's absence as Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro provided the attacking threat.
In the absence of any suggestion Blues owner Roman Abramovich will bow to pressure to sell in January, the priority now is to get the combustible Spain striker back on side and ensure any unrest does not spread.
If that can be done, then Chelsea can look back at a weekend where their title position was strengthened as they now stand seven points clear.
Verdict: Back on track and clear title favourites.
Form: Won past six.
Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Manchester City (away), 31 January - Sunderland (away), 4 February - Middlesbrough (home).
Mauricio Pochettino's side are a growing force in this title race and the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion was further evidence of their growing authority.
It was their sixth straight league win since their loss at Manchester United in December - and they have only lost two games out of 21.
Harry Kane is firing on all cylinders, shown by his hat-trick against West Brom, and with Dele Alli scoring seven goals in his past five league games Spurs are starting to look the full package.
They ran out of steam towards the end of last season, but Pochettino is a top-class operator who will surely have learned his lesson and tailored his team's intense style accordingly.
The Argentine will still hope to avoid injuries and there is a real worry over influential defender Jan Vertonghen, who Pochettino fears has suffered a ""bad"" ankle injury.
Next weekend's game at Manchester City will tell us even more about them.
Verdict: Flew under the radar for a while but now right at the heart of the title race.
Form: One defeat in past 19.
Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Swansea (home), 31 January - Chelsea (home), 4 February - Hull (away).
Liverpool will be disappointed they could not hold on for victory at Manchester United on Sunday, but there is plenty of encouragement to take from their performance.
The disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table.
It is to the Reds' credit that they came so close to victory despite key men such as Philippe Coutinho still not fit enough to start, Nathaniel Clyne out with a rib injury and Joel Matip sidelined because of confusion surrounding his absence from Cameroon's Africa Cup Of Nations squad.
Manager Jurgen Klopp rightly believes they are still in a strong position but will surely be frustrated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late goal means Chelsea stretched their advantage to seven points.
Verdict: Remain title contenders but top four would still be fine achievement.
Form: Unbeaten in past four.
Upcoming fixtures: 22 January - Burnley (home), 31 January - Watford (home), 4 February - Chelsea (away).
Arsenal's win at Swansea City could not have been more convincing and they have responded well to successive losses at Everton and Manchester City, when they conceded winning positions and showed the vulnerability that has haunted them for seasons.
Even at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far.
Are they, however, potential Premier League winners? They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea.
Verdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down?
Form: Two defeats in past three.
Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Tottenham (home), 1 February - West Ham (away), 5 February - Swansea (home).
Manager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton.
City now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season.
And this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals.
Only five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games.
The problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults.
City have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea.
Verdict: Forget the title. Manchester City are in a top-four fight now.
Form: Unbeaten in past 12.
Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Stoke (away), 1 February - Hull (home), 5 February - Leicester (away).
Manchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title.
They could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea.
United have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit.
Mourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season.
Verdict: Top four should be the target. The title is now out of reach.",Chelsea's Premier League title rivals thought the door had been pushed ajar after a run on 13 straight wins ended at Tottenham and the new harmony under manager Antonio Conte was disturbed by Diego Costa.

Robredo, who struggled with a leg injury in the closing stages, fought back superbly from 5-3 down in the fourth set to claim victory.
Evans, ranked 179th, earned £60,000 in prize money for his efforts and enough points to get close to the world's top 150, but missed out on a possible dream fourth-round match against Roger Federer.
""It was a tough one, especially to go down in the fourth set after serving for it and having two set points,"" Evans told BBC Radio 5 live.
""I felt in pretty much total control of the match. The last point is always the hardest one and I couldn't get that last point of the set to take it to a fifth.
""I just played two really loose points - that's all it was. They came at the wrong time. I just have to learn on that for next time.""
It was the British number three's sixth match in 10 days at Flushing Meadows after coming through three rounds of qualifying, then beating 11th seed Kei Nishikori and world number 52 Bernard Tomic.
He had never won a match in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament before New York, and playing under lights on the Louis Armstrong Stadium, albeit in front of a sparse crowd, was a far cry from the Challenger events he is more used to.
Evans impressed in the opening set but 31-year-old Robredo's experience told as he edged it in the tie-break, then raced through the second in just 28 minutes.
Defeat was not far away for Evans at 4-4 in the third but he got the vital break with a sharp backhand volley, pumping his fist as he made his way back to the chair, and served out the set to love with an ace.
""I was sure the match was heading to a fifth set but Dan Evans just tightened up. After missing those set points in the fourth, he started rushing a bit, showed his inexperience and made a couple of bad shot choices.
""It is such a shame for him, but once he gets over the disappointment there is no doubt that there are so many positives. It looks like his career is going to go to another level after this tournament.""
Things seemed to be turning Evans's way when Robredo spent the next two changeovers having his left thigh massaged, but the Spaniard fought magnificently in the fourth set.
Evans was bristling with positive intent, moving forward at every opportunity, and twice broke to go ahead, but, serving at 5-3, 40-15, the nerves appeared to bite and he gave the set points up with a double fault and an error.
Robredo sensed his chance and pounded away from the baseline, drawing two more errors to recover the game and, after a solid hold, the pressure was quickly back on Evans.
From standing on the verge of a fifth set, Evans was now serving to stay in the match, and a wayward drop shot and a double fault brought Robredo to match point.
He closed in on the net to chase down another drop shot and leapt upon the Briton's response to angle away the volley and bring Evans's amazing US Open campaign to a sudden end.
""It's been a great experience, a great learning curve,"" added Evans, who heads to Croatia next for Great Britain's Davis Cup tie on 13-15 September.

72,"The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty of Pakistani national Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the sole surviving gunman of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai, has opened the debate once again.
Predictably, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to demand Qasab's swift execution ""as those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy"".
Qasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict; and his last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president.
His appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a ""rarest of the rare crime"", a condition for handing out the death penalty in India.
But, as critics of capital punishment say, there's no evidence to show that the death penalty deters crime.
Two-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions.
India has shied away from executing people for many years now.
There have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term.
Clemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004.
Then there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution.
Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous.
""Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,"" says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.
What do you think?",Should India abolish the death penalty?
73,"An operation to pump 3,000 tonnes of water out of the Hoegh Osaka is expected to last until Sunday.
But poor weather conditions has made it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday to finalise pumping arrangements.
High winds of up to 83mph during the night caused the vessel to drag anchor for approximately 100 metres.
The ship had been anchored to help control its movement.
Salvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as ""difficult"".
The Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday.
Water, described as being ""lightly contaminated with oil"" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease.
The film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold.
With no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution.
Divers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday.
The Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent.
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: ""I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel.""
The 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter ""refloated"" itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide.
It was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a ""small opening in the vessel"" that had since been closed.
A refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank.
Salvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan.
The Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list.
There were 1,400 cars on board, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel.
Two crew members out of 25 rescued by RNLI Lifeboats and the Solent Coastguard on Saturday suffered non-life threatening injuries.
Two senior officers and a pilot stayed on board before being taken ashore.",High winds are affecting the operation to salvage the cargo ship that ran aground in the Solent.
74,"They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans.
The diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.
Researchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.
The study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.
Diamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.
A research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.
They noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.
While ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.
While this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.
Dr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: ""Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.""
The observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.
Discussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: ""The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.
""It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.""
Describing his diamond sample, he said: ""It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.""
Prof Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.
He said: ""I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.
""This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.""
A key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.
Ringwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.
Grains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.
Given the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term ""blue planet"" seems even more appropriate for Earth.",Minerals preserved in diamond have revealed hints of the bright blue rocks that exist deep within the Earth.

It's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.
""Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.""
For four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.
Cotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.
He's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.
He has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.
Cotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. ""I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,"" he says.
I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here
""I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.""
He tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been ""scuffles"" and Lourdes had come off second best.
""Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,"" Cotter recounts. ""The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.
""There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.
""It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.""
Years later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.
Eight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.
In 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.
Clermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?
""It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,"" he explains.
""One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.
""Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.
""Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.
""Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.
""Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.""
In Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.

Scotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.
""The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,"" says Cotter. ""It was about creating clarity.
""The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.
""You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.
""There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.""

On the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. ""We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,"" Cotter recalls.
""We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.
""It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.""
Beyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.
""We know that these teams are very good,"" he insists. ""When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.""
Five more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.
When the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.
He would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.
Will he miss it? ""Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,"" he says. ""You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.
""It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.""
Cotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.
""I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,"" he explains. ""I recognise it in our rural communities.
""I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.
""We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.
""It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.""
More than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road.
""They give everything, these guys,"" he adds. ""They're striving to give people something to be proud of. The stadium is a sell-out for Ireland. So, game on...""",The old footage begins with a large man in a blue tracksuit walking across a pitch and casually kicking a rugby ball out of his road.

82,"England made only 134-8 despite being well set on 50-1 after six overs, Jos Buttler top-scoring with 32 not out while spinner Imran Tahir took 4-21.
The hosts needed 15 runs from the final over and two off the last delivery.
Chris Morris scampered two as bowler Reece Topley failed to collect Joe Root's throw from long-off.
Morris, who also produced a match-winning 62 off 38 balls in the fourth one-day international, finished with 17 not out off seven balls.
The defeat was England's fourth in a row following their 3-2 reverse in the one-day series, but only their first loss in seven Twenty20 internationals.
The second game of the two-match series takes places in Johannesburg on Sunday.
That will be England's last competitive match before their opening game of the World Twenty20 on 16 March.
England knew they needed wickets to have any chance of winning and their hopes were boosted when Chris Jordan (3-23) dismissed AB de Villiers cheaply and Ben Stokes (1-19) removed Hashim Amla for 22 in a wicket-maiden.
Adil Rashid claimed the wicket of JP Duminy and fellow spinner Moeen Ali struck twice, including the wicket of top scorer Faf du Plessis for 25, to make the hosts nervous.
David Miller hit a six and a four in the 18th over but Jordan had him caught on the boundary and bowled David Wiese via an inside edge in a superb penultimate over that cost only six runs.
After Kyle Abbott ran a single off the first ball of the final over, Morris struck successive full tosses from Topley for four and six.
However, a dot ball was followed by two to long-off, leaving Morris on strike for the last delivery of the game.
Root's throw on the bounce was accurate but Topley, at the non-striker's end, fumbled the ball with Morris short of his ground.
Had Topley completed the run-out, the game would have gone to a super over.
Alex Hales helped get England off to a promising start with the bat but became Tahir's first wicket when he was caught for 27, Duminy taking a high catch despite team-mate Kagiso Rabada almost rugby-tackling him in a race for the ball.
Three balls later Root fell for eight to Wiese's first delivery and Stokes was stumped off Tahir the ball after hitting a muscular six.
Tahir then dismissed Morgan for 10 and Moeen first ball, and came within a whisker of a hat-trick as Jordan was beaten by a googly that went between bat and pad.
Helped by the accurate Wiese, who conceded only 19 off four overs, South Africa allowed only one boundary between the start of the eighth over and the end of the 14th.
England's 100 came up in 16th over but with Buttler restrained by the circumstances, they were unable to set the total they would have desired.
South Africa are now unbeaten in their past 13 matches against England at Newlands - a run that goes back to January 1957.
They have won 10 and drawn three matches, having played six Tests, five ODIs and two T20s.
England captain Eoin Morgan: ""After a pretty poor batting display our bowlers nearly pulled it out of the bag.
""Stokes and Jordan got as much as they could out of the pitch. The more and more we play the more responsibility the bowlers take on their shoulders.
""We created chances with an under-par score. That is a huge positive.
""We have had a reasonably good run in T20s and probably should have won tonight when we didn't deserve to.""
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis: ""That's a massive get-out-of-jail card.
""Neither team played their best because the wicket was two-paced and not a normal T20 wicket, but I have a smile on my face because we won.
""We didn't start well. Twenty20 cricket is all about executing plans and we let them get away at the start. Our bowlers came back by getting wickets.
""We tried to learn from their mistakes - maybe they went a bit hard at the ball - and we tried to play deeper. We messed it up a little but Chris Morris, the million-dollar man, saved us.""",England missed a run-out off the final ball as South Africa won the first Twenty20 international by three wickets in Cape Town.
83,"Labour said 160,000 people would lose out as a result of changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs).
The disability minister said new rules to clarify eligibility criteria for payments would ensure those most in need received maximum support.
The action follows two court judgements on how benefits claims are scored.
Labour said the government was not listening to criticism of how payments are assessed.
The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses ""as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits"".
Disability rights campaigners said the changes were one of a number of cuts and changes faced by disabled people and those in ill health.
Two tribunal rulings came in late 2016. One found someone who needed support at home to take medication or monitor a health condition like diabetes would score the same on the benefits criteria as people who needed help with a therapy such as kidney dialysis.
A second ruling said people who struggled to travel independently because of conditions such as anxiety scored the same as someone who was, for example, blind.
The government said the combined effects of the rulings would have added £3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023.
The benefit payments are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs.
The replacement of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which was partly self-assessed, with PIPs, where eligibility is tested by a company, has been controversial.
Eligibility for PIPs is reviewed regularly and the qualifying criteria are also stricter.
In a written statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Penny Mordaunt said the government monitored how effective the payment was in supporting those facing the greatest barriers to leading independent lives.
She said that PIPs were designed to give ""non-physical conditions... the same recognition as physical ones"".
But she added: ""Now, over two thirds of PIP claimants with mental health conditions get the higher Daily Living award, worth £82.30 per week, compared to 22% under DLA.""
She said amendments to the criteria would ""provide greater clarity"", saying: ""This will not result in any claimants seeing a reduction in the amount of PIP previously awarded by DWP (the Department of Work and Pensions).""
But Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said: ""Instead of listening to the court's criticisms of Personal Independence Payment assessments and correcting these injustices, the government has instead decided to undermine the legal basis of the rulings.""
It was an ""unprecedented attempt"" to subvert a tribunal judgement, she said.
She said Labour would fight changes to ""strip"" entitlements from more than 160,000 disabled people - describing them as a ""step too far, even for this Tory government"".
A Lib Dem work and pensions spokeswoman said it was ""utterly outrageous"" the government was using the ruling to ""make matters worse"" for disabled people.
""What makes things even worse is that they have sneaked this announcement out under the cover of [Thursday's] by-elections,"" she said.
Campaigners said the government should instead embrace the tribunal's findings.
Philip Connolly from Disability Rights UK said the changes showed ""escalating levels of unfairness"" in the government's approach to a benefit it had created.
People with ""very serious conditions"" including dementia, learning difficulties and diabetes would be hit, he said.
This change was one of several benefit cuts disabled people faced, he said.
Campaigners are due to stage a protest in Westminster on Wednesday about a £29-a-week cut to employment support payments.
A DWP spokeswoman said the government was ""committed to ensuring our welfare system is a strong safety net for those who need it.
""That's why we spend around £50bn a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.""",Opposition parties have criticised moves to cut £3.7bn from the benefits bill by reducing the number of people eligible for disability benefit.

85,"Pre-tax profits fell to £78.7m in the first six months of the year, down 35% from £121.8m a year earlier.
It paid an additional £44m in gambling duties, following changes to the taxation of online betting and fixed-odds betting terminals.
William Hill also said it had bought a 29.4% stake in online lottery firm NeoGames for $25m (£16m).
Shares in the bookmaker had fallen more than 7% by late morning.
In December last year, a new Point of Consumption Tax came into effect, which applies to gambling profits generated from UK customers.
In addition, Machine Games Duty - the levy paid on fixed-odds betting terminals - was increased to 25% in March.
The company's chief executive, James Henderson, said: ""We have delivered a good operational performance in the past six months during a period of significant regulatory and taxation change for the industry.
""Whilst factors such as the Point of Consumption Tax and the increase in the Machine Games Duty rate have impacted our cost base as expected, we continue to progress our strategy and invest in our long-term growth drivers.""
William Hill's profits were also hit by one-off costs relating to the rebranding of its operations in Australia.
The fall in profit came despite a slight increase in net revenues to £808.1m from £805.2m a year earlier.
The bookmaker also said that the introduction of the government's National Living Wage would cost it about £1m-£2m in 2016.
Referring to William Hill's purchase of the stake in NeoGames, Mr Henderson described the online lottery market as an ""exciting opportunity"".

In football, Leicester are five points clear with seven games left.
""It's good, it's better being compared to someone at the top,"" Brown told the BBC Super League Show.
""I don't really listen to what people say about where we finish, as long as we're playing well and doing our thing you can compare us to whoever you want.

The Vikings have scored 230 points so this season, the highest in Super League, and only Wigan and Warrington have conceded fewer.
Key to their improvement has been the acquisition of strong forwards and a toughness instilled by head coach Denis Betts and his coaching staff.
""Our attack has been pretty good for the last few years but the fact we've got real lads working their socks off in the middle coupled with some really good edge defenders,"" said Brown.
""The lads who have come in have helped our attack but Chris Houston, Corey Thompson, Chris Bridge, Charly Runciman - these lads are competent, experienced players who know how to defend.

87,"This follows earlier warnings that the reef was experiencing its worst coral bleaching event on record.
Prof Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce told the BBC the link between bleaching and global warming was ""very well established"".
Rising water temperatures cause corals to drive out colour-giving algae.
The corals can die if conditions do not return to normal.
In pictures: Great Barrier Reef
Vinegar could help save Barrier Reef
The taskforce's survey shows that the extent of the damage is most severe in the northern section of the 2,300km (1,429 mile)-long reef, which lies off the coast of Queensland state.
Only 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Prof Hughes said.
The effects of El Nino, as well as climate change, are being blamed for the rise in sea temperatures that causes the bleaching.
More than 900 individual reefs were surveyed using a light plane and a helicopter, with the accuracy of the aerial survey then checked by teams of scuba divers.
""I'm inherently an optimist, but I think we have a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to save the Great Barrier Reef,"" Prof Hughes said.
""If we don't take action on global warming it will become more degraded.
""After three bleaching events the mix of coral species has already changed.""
This bleaching event is far more severe than previous bleaching events recorded in 2002 and 1998, he said.
""We know that this time only 7% of the reef didn't bleach. It was closer to 40% in the other two events.
""If these events start coming as frequently as every five to 10 years there will not be sufficient coral regeneration,"" he said.
Tourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said.
""Thankfully many parts of the reef are still in excellent shape,"" said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council in a statement.
""But we can't just ignore coral bleaching and hope for a swift recovery.""
The current worldwide bleaching event, which is also affecting reefs on Australia's north-west coast, is predicted to be the worst on record.
The Australian Department of Environment previously said that state and federal governments were investing a projected A$2bn over the next decade to protect the reef.",An extensive aerial and underwater survey has revealed that 93% of Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been affected by coral bleaching.

Sentencing is expected to be pronounced on Monday after judge Yatin D Shinde hears arguments from the prosecutors and defence lawyers. The guilty face the death penalty or life in prison.
""Justice has been done for the people of Mumbai.  I will ask for the strictest punishment when I argue for their sentences,"" public prosecutor Raja Thakre told reporters.

The blasts took place in the areas of Matunga, Khar, Mahim, Jogeshwari, Borivali and Mira Road, with most on moving trains and two at stations.
The bombs appeared to have targeted first-class compartments, as commuters were returning home from the city's financial district.
More than 200 witnesses were examined during the eight-year-long trial, which concluded in August last year.
Prosecutors say the attack was planned by Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI, and carried out by operatives of Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba with help from the Students' Islamic Movement of India, a banned Indian group.
Pakistan had rejected the allegations and said India had given no evidence of Pakistani involvement in the attacks.

91,"A new study by Cancer Research UK found that more than a third of Scots ate confectionary at least once a day.
It warned that being overweight was the single biggest cause of preventable cancer after smoking.
The Scottish government said it was committed to tackling obesity.
Thirteen types of cancer, including bowel, breast and pancreatic, are linked to a person's weight, according to Cancer Research UK.
The charity said its research revealed that 39% of Scots consumed confectionery at least once a day and almost a fifth (18%) of Scots have a soft drink which contained sugar at least once a day.
About two-thirds (65%) of adults in Scotland and more than one quarter (28%) of children were found to be overweight or obese.
The findings, for Cancer Research UK's Scale Down Cancer campaign, were based on a YouGov survey of 3,293 UK adults, 513 in Scotland, carried out between 24 February and 8 March 2016.
Cancer Research UK is calling on the Scottish government to act to make it easier to shop healthily and improve the diets of Scots.
The charity's cancer prevention expert Professor Linda Bauld, who is based at the University of Stirling, said: ""Scotland's sweet tooth is a huge worry for the health of the nation.
""Sugar should form no more than 5% of our diet but, on average, both adults and children in Scotland consume much more than this.
""Too much sugar in our diet can lead to weight gain - which is not just linked to cancer, but also the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and tooth decay.
""If left unchecked, obesity will lead to a rising tide in ill health, including cancers, and become a crippling burden on the NHS.""
The charity said foods on promotion accounted for about 40% of all expenditure on food and drink consumed at home.
It wants restrictions on supermarket multi-buy discounts on foods that are high in sugar, fat and salt to form part of measures in the expected Scottish government strategy to improve diets.
The charity said half (52%) of adults in Scotland had a ready meal once a week or more and 16% eat fast food or a takeaway at least once a week.
Prof Bauld added: ""The Scottish government can, and must, do more to make it easier to shop healthily and serve up a better future for our young people. We need urgent action now to prevent thousands of cancers in the future.""
Food Standards Scotland said it supported the charity's call for action but it cautioned that there was no ""single silver bullet"" to Scotland's obesity problem.
Its head of nutrition science and policy, Heather Peace, said: ""We all need to recognise there is a problem and everyone, including consumers, the food and drink industry, retailers, media and government has a part to play in finding a solution.""
Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said: ""We are committed to tackling Scotland's obesity problems and will consult on our new diet and obesity strategy this year, building on our wide range of activity to make it easier for people to be more active, eat less and eat better.
""We're investing Â£12m over five years to 2017 on a range of programmes to specifically tackle the nation's poor diet, including engaging with the food and drink industry on action to offer healthier choices, rebalance promotions, and reformulate products with a focus on reducing calories, salt, fats and added sugar.""","Scotland has been warned it is hurtling towards an ""epidemic of larger waistlines and increased cancer risk"" fuelled by people's love of sweet treats and fast food."

The family has been raising money for her medical bills and several Wisconsin businesses have come forward to host fundraisers.
""The compassion and love expressed to our family by the people of Wisconsin [and from people around the world] has greatly assisted our family in this healing process,"" the family said in a statement.
""The prayers, cards, hearts, notes, financial support, and now this heartfelt proclamation truly demonstrates that through this tragedy that there is so much goodness in the world.""

94,"The Scottish capital's trams began running on Saturday, after six years of disruption and cost increases.
Mr Salmond cited ""considerable public concern"" over the Â£776m project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh.
The problems included a dispute between the city council and its contractor.
The first minister stopped short of announcing a full public inquiry, raising concerns over the timescale, and instead decided on a ""non-statutory"" option.
Speaking during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said: ""I am sure that everyone in Edinburgh, and indeed all over Scotland, will be delighted to see that the Edinburgh trams are fully operational and carrying passengers.
""We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to households and businesses in the city of Edinburgh.
""I therefore recommended to the Cabinet, and it has been decided, to establish a judge-led public inquiry into the Edinburgh trams project to establish why the project occurred significant overruns in terms of cost and timing, requiring in particular a considerable reduction in the original scope.""
He added that the government had been assured by the City of Edinburgh Council that it would fully cooperate with the inquiry.
The first minister added: ""There are lessons to be learned from the conduct of the Edinburgh trams project and I think the course of action we are proposing will be a substantial assistance in doing that.""
Mr Salmond was responding to a question from Marco Biagi, the SNP MSP for Edinburgh Central and an opponent of the city's trams, which run on an 8.7-mile route, from the New Town to Edinburgh Airport.
""All of us who opposed the trams project from the start as risky and over-engineered have been disappointed almost daily by being shown to be right,"" said Mr Biagi.
""Now that the trams are indeed rolling, if there is to be any faith from the public in future management or potential cost estimates for projects like this, we need to know for sure that these mistakes will never be repeated"".
In the decade since the first money was allocated to the project, the price has doubled, the tram network has halved and it has taken twice as long to build as originally planned.
Four years ago, a bitter dispute between Transport Edinburgh Limited, the arms-length company responsible for delivering the project, and main contractor Bilfinger Berger brought the whole project to a halt for months.","Edinburgh's troubled tram project will be investigated by a judge-led inquiry, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has announced."

The boss of North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust said it does not look like Whitehaven has the ""infrastructure"" to maintain services.
Midwives have raised safety concerns.
They have warned mothers and babies ""may die"" if consultant-led maternity services are removed from Whitehaven and concentrated at Carlisle Cumberland Infirmary.
Trust chief executive Stephen Eames told BBC Cumbria: ""The options we are looking at are likely to mean there will be changes in maternity services and they're likely to mean we'll need to concentrate our expertise in our consultant staff in one place.
""Everybody involved would prefer a consultant-led service in both, but I think the reality is it isn't just about maternity, it's about the other clinical services that support it.
""So while we've made some improvements in children's services recruitment it doesn't look like we can recruit the infrastructure to support two independent consultant-led services.""
Midwives at Whitehaven are concerned mothers facing unexpected problems would need a potentially risky 40-mile (64km) transfer across the county.

The 77th Brigade, made up of reservists and regular troops and based in Hermitage, Berkshire, will be formally created in April.
It has been inspired by the Chindits who fought in Burma in World War Two.
An Army spokesman said the unit would ""play a key part in enabling the UK to fight in the information age"" and that it ""consists of more than just traditional capabilities"".
He said: ""77 Brigade is being created to draw together a host of existing and developing capabilities essential to meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare.
""It recognises that the actions of others in a modern battlefield can be affected in ways that are not necessarily violent and it draws heavily on important lessons from our commitments to operations in Afghanistan amongst others.""
Recruitment for the brigade, 42% of whose personnel will be reservists, will begin this spring.
Its members will come from the Royal Navy and RAF as well as from the Army.
One former commander of British forces in Afghanistan has warned the new operation should not mean fewer troops on the frontline.
Colonel Richard Kemp said: ""My view is that this should not be done at the expense of combat troops. Where are these 2,000 people going to come from?""
""They are likely to come from savings made in combat troops. I think that's a mistake.
""I think the British forces have already been cut far too much in a very uncertain and increasingly dangerous world.
He acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said ""it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere.""
The creation of the new unit is part of a major restructuring of the military under the Army 2020 plan, which will see the military scaled down to around 82,000 regular troops in the next five years.
The unit will also seek ""new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts"".
The Army spokesman said it would share the ""spirit of innovation"" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945.
Chindits was the name given to the Long Range Penetration (LRP) groups that operated in the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines, targeting Japanese communications.
The new unit will also use the old Chindit insignia of a Chinthe, a mythical Burmese creature which is half-lion and half-dragon.
Tony Redding from Kent, whose father was in the Chindits, told the BBC he was disappointed by the move. He said: ""Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way.
""I've tried very hard to look for similarities and the only common denominator I can find is that the Chindits 70 years ago were a highly unconventional force. Perhaps this new force are to use some unconventional means of warfare.""

The Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.
The brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of ""psyops"" - psychological operations.
They will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means.
Civilians with the right skills will work alongside regular troops and reservists and could be sent anywhere in the world to help win hearts and minds.
It can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election.
Paul Rogers, a professor of international security at the University of Bradford, said the announcement represented a ""big expansion"" of the Army's psychological operations and was an ""attempt to rebrand and update"" this area of its work.
""We had so much difficulty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's about trying to learn the lessons of how these groups are using social media,"" Prof Rogers explained.
He added: ""In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards.
""We've seen with Islamic State, its incredible capability on the net, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest.""
A former Army officer involved in psychological operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Simon Bergman, predicted it would help build ""the Army for the future"".
""For example, 77 brigade have a large component of civil affairs soldiers who'll be operating in populations, working with them, achieving military effects - and a broader effect, because as we know from Afghanistan, the military doesn't work in isolation. It works as a component of government.""","The Army is setting up a new unit that will use psychological operations and social media to help fight wars ""in the information age""."

103,"Sarah Sands, 32, killed her 77-year-old neighbour Michael Pleasted weeks after finding out he allegedly abused three boys, the Old Bailey was told.
She told police that Mr Pleasted, who had been charged with sexual assaults on two children aged under 13, had been ""asking for trouble"".
He was killed in his Canning Town flat on 28 November. Ms Sands denies murder.
The court heard how Ms Sands armed herself with a knife after drinking two bottles of wine and a bottle of brandy.
The case's prosecutor Jonathan Ree said CCTV footage showed she was in his block of flats for 20 minutes.
Mr Pleasted, who was stabbed eight times, had been on bail awaiting trial. Police were also investigating an allegation he had abused a third boy.
Ms Sands had befriended the pensioner who was a familiar local figure and ran a bric-a-brac shop from a Mace convenience store, the court heard.
She used to visit him at his flat and bring him meals before she became aware of the abuse allegations.
After the stabbing, Ms Sands went to the Isle of Dogs, putting the knife and clothes she had been wearing in a carrier bag.
Before deciding to hand herself in, she told a family friend: ""I stabbed him"".
During a police interview, she said she had tried to help him, while all the while he was abusing young children.
She later said in a statement that she denied intending to kill Mr Pleasted or cause him serious bodily harm, claiming she went to confront him and took a knife for protection as she was scared.
The trial continues.","A woman stabbed a suspected paedophile to death in east London before handing herself into police, a court has heard."
104,"Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released a report criticising conditions at a detention centre on the island of Nauru.
The report concluded that Australia must intentionally allow abuse of detainees to deter asylum seekers.
A statement from the Immigration Department criticised Amnesty for not consulting the government.
""There was no consultation with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from Amnesty International in preparation of this report,"" the statement said.
""We strongly refute many of the allegations in the report and would encourage Amnesty International to contact the Department before airing allegations of this kind.""
The statement said Australia did not exert control over the laws of Nauru, a sovereign country. It said the Australian government welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities.

The Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report was written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month. The organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia.
No documentary evidence was provided in the report to support the claim.
But interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions.
The detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government.
One woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her.
Although most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said.
The report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse.","Australia's government has ""strongly"" refuted claims it deliberately ignores abuse of asylum seekers."
105,"Assembly Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said although devolved, health was one of the main election issues for voters.
""Wherever you go across Wales people raise the issue of the NHS, and Labour are running the NHS in Wales,"" he said.
Labour responded saying that Tory sums on the NHS ""simply don't add up"".
Mr Davies said Welsh Conservatives would protect health spending and introduce a cancer drugs fund.
He defended his party's decision to campaign on an area of policy that was not controlled in Wales by Westminster.
""(Labour leader) Ed Miliband has used the example of 'compare and contrast', and I think it is perfectly reasonable to point out we don't have a cancer drugs fund here in Wales and some of the most disappointing ambulance response times on record,"" he said.
""There is a real dilemma for voters in May. Do they want to vote for the Conservative party who want to protect health spending or do they endorse a party who have drastically cut health provision in Wales?""
But Welsh Labour's Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething accused the Conservatives of wanting to privatise the NHS.
""The Tories have had three opportunities in the campaign so far to rule out privatising the NHS and they have refused to do so"" he said.
He added: ""This election is a clear choice between a Labour government that would invest in the NHS to train an extra 1000 doctors, nurses and front-line staff, or a Tory government that would introduce a tablet tax for sick people and privatise health services.""
Elsewhere on the campaign trail on Monday, Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams was promising better rural health care while visiting target seats in mid Wales.
Ms Williams said her party wanted to invest in cottage hospitals and community care.
""An urgent care centre in Montgomeryshire is essential if we are to relieve pressure on A&E departments and cut waiting times,"" she said.
Plaid Cymru accused its rivals of neglecting the economy of north Wales.

It prompted complaints that the signs were spoiling a conservation area.
The council said it used railings as much as possible to minimise posts in the pavement.
It said it ""met regularly"" with English Heritage to talk about listed building work and legislation.
The council said when signs were put up in the Kingsdown conservation area it was advised as long as it was not making ""significant or permanent changes to a building, which would alter its character, it was acceptable"".
English Heritage's letter, seen by the BBC, raised the ""potential cumulative impact"" of the signs in West Mall and Caledonia Place, which contains listed buildings.
""We would suggest that taken together such work might fall within Section 7 of the [Planning and Listed Buildings and Conservation 1990] Act,"" it said.

109,"Civil protection officials have already revealed that rescuers were let down by the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster.
Now details have emerged of pleas for help that did not get through to commanders on the ground.
The government has ordered an investigation into the network.
The fire began in the Pedrógão Grande area during the afternoon on 17 June and within hours the failures of the emergency network, which relies on mobile antennas, were becoming clear.
The first failure came at 19:45 on 17 June. Three people dialled the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that the building was surrounded by flames. Emergency services tried to contact the local command post and the deputy commander but were unable to get through, according to a civil protection authority (ANPC) timeline, described by Portuguese media as a ""black box"".
Five minutes later, officials were unable to contact a command post to help a father and son in trouble a few kilometres away in Troviscais. These and several other cases are documented throughout the night by the Público and Jornal de Notícias websites.
At 01:02 on 18 June comes the most chilling entry on the civil protection authority's log, in a reference to the deaths of 47 people on a single stretch of the N-236 road. Thirty of the victims died in their cars. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling ""breakdowns in the Siresp network"" and for ""lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through"".
The civil protection authority has already confirmed ""failures in the Siresp network"" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network.
The government on Monday said it had asked for a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week that the network had suffered because cables and communication towers had been damaged by the fire. However, he said the mobile network had provided temporary mobile antennas.
The forest fires were the worst in Portugal's history, with 64 dead and 254 injured.
Portugal's Siresp (joint emergency and security network system) has had a chequered past. It was set up in 2006 as a partnership between the government and private sector.
The system stopped working during a rescue attempt in storms in January 2013 and it was linked to the deaths of two firefighters a few months later.","At least 10 emergency calls failed to reach firefighters last week during the forest fires in which 64 people died, reports say."

Platini is seeking the next presidency, as is Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.
Frenchman Platini, president of European football's governing body Uefa, submitted his candidacy papers earlier this month, but Fifa says it cannot recognise his candidacy while his ban is in place and he cannot campaign.
However, Fifa's electoral committee says it may allow him to stand if his suspension ends before the election date.
Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain is expected to contest the election. Former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid said he will stand, while ex-Tottenham defender Ramon Vega is considering doing likewise.

The UK monarch, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, laid a wreath at a memorial there on the final day of her four-day state visit to Germany.
She met British veterans who liberated the camp, and heard stories of the ""horrific"" scenes that greeted them.
More than 50,000 prisoners from all over Europe were killed at Bergen-Belsen or died later as a result of their treatment in the camp.
This was a Queen who lived through World War Two as a teenager, coming to learn first-hand about some of the very worst excesses of a former enemy.
With Prince Philip she passed the mounds that mark where the mass graves are.  There are 13 mounds.  They contain the remains of more than 20,000 people.
There was no pomp or ceremony; just a couple from the wartime generation taking their time to reflect and to pay their respects.
The 89-year-old Queen and her husband, who's 94, walked quite a distance through what remains of the camp, and met a few of those who lived and three of the British soldiers who set them free.  The survivors and the liberators told them about their shared experience of horror.
At the end the Queen said to one person: ""It's difficult to imagine isn't it?""

The Queen, who is patron of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, had not visited a concentration camp before and it is believed she requested the trip.
She was taken on a tour of the site - which was razed to the ground and is now a museum and memorial to those who died - with the minimum of protocol.
She met with representatives of Jewish and Christian communities, as well as a small group of survivors and liberators.
Among them was veteran pilot Captain Eric ""Winkle"" Brown, 96. The Queen asked him what sort of scene greeted the British troops when he first arrived.
""I told her this was just a field of corpses,"" he said.
He said the Queen replied: ""It must have been horrific really.""
""She was listening very carefully. I would say she was quite affected by the atmosphere here. You can't avoid it, can you?"" he added.
The Queen also visited a memorial to Anne Frank and her sister Margot.
Millions of copies of Anne Frank's Diary, written during the two years the teenager and her family hid from the Nazis in occupied Amsterdam, have been sold across the world.
Dr Jens-Christian Wagner, head of the Bergen-Belsen Memorial who gave the royal couple a guided tour, said the experience of visiting the site had been an emotional one for the Queen.
British troops found 60,000 prisoners when they entered the gates in April 1945, suffering from malnutrition, disease and the brutal treatment they had endured.
Thousands of corpses also lay unburied on the camp grounds.
Another of the first British soldiers to arrive after liberation described the scene to BBC Radio 5live.
Corporal Bernard Levy, who was 19 at the time, said: ""It was so horrendous that nobody could take it in.
""For 68 years I'd shut the whole subject out of my mind.

More protesters with banners saying ""Black lives matter"" gathered in Madison after the attorney made his announcement on Tuesday.
Mr Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, vowed to continue the ""fight"" as she addressed a crowd of supporters outside Grace Episcopal Church.
Earlier, Mr Ozanne had said: ""This tragic and unfortunate death was the result of a lawful use of deadly police force and no charges should be brought against Kenny.""
Officer Kenny was responding to an emergency call about a man obstructing traffic who had allegedly been involved in an assault, when he confronted Robinson.
On the night of the shooting, Robinson had various illicit drugs in his system, according to autopsy reports.
His friends who made multiple 911 calls said he was ""acting crazy"" and tried to choke one of them. They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said.

Top of the list was a London restaurant which owed almost £100,000 to 30 employees.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said all the money owed had been paid back to workers.
The list was the largest of its kind since the ""naming and shaming"" scheme was introduced in October 2013.
The department said 688 employers in total have been publicly identified for flouting the law, with total arrears of more than £3.5m.
Business Minister Margot James said: ""It is not acceptable that some employers fail to pay at least the minimum wage their workers are entitled to.
""So we'll continue to crack down on those who ignore the law, including by naming and shaming them.""
Restaurant San Lorenzo in Wimbledon, South West London, owed £99,541.98 to 30 workers, while Premier Recruitment Ltd in Derby owed £34,797.33 to 424 workers.
Also on the list were football clubs Blackpool FC and Brighton and Hove Albion, which owed £2,861.64 to one worker.
Brighton and Hove Albion said its reputation had been ""unfairly tarnished"" by its inclusion on the list, claiming the case was a ""minor administrative error"" which resulted from being ""over generous"" in paying expenses to someone on work experience two years ago.
A spokesman for the club insisted: ""We are one of the few clubs who pays its staff over and above the National Living Wage.""
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for the ""worst offenders"" to be prosecuted, adding: ""Bosses who try to duck the minimum wage must have nowhere to hide.
""The level of underpayment in some cases is truly eye-watering.""
The list comes after the new National Living Wage was introduced in April, requiring employers to pay at least £7.20 an hour to employees aged 25 and over.
However, the Living Wage Foundation calculates that a rate of £8.25 per hour is required to meet the cost of living, rising to £9.40 in London. Some employers pay this higher living wage voluntarily.
The National Living Wage of £6.70 an hour applies to workers aged 21 to 24, with lower rates for younger people and apprentices.
The government's list includes firms that have failed to pay either the minimum wage or the National Living Wage.
Conor D'Arcy from think tank the Resolution Foundation backed the government's policy of naming and shaming but added: ""With the number of people on the wage floor set to treble over the next four years, the government will need to strengthen its resources for enforcing both the national minimum wage and the national living wage.""

Over 800 sightings were also reported in neighbouring Singapore last month, sparking intense online debate.
The Lyssa Zampa tropical moth, which is also known as the Laos brown butterfly, is native to South East Asia.
Biology lecturer N Sivasothi said that while the moth sightings appear to be ""unprecedented"", it is not a new phenomenon.
""The moths are actually present during other times of the year but in very small numbers, so they are usually not noticed by people,"" Mr Sivasothi said, adding that the creatures typically emerge between April and August every year.
Ecologist Anuj Jain said moths' use of light for navigation often causes them to head to built-up areas.
""Their tendency to emigrate in search of new uneaten host plants attracts these moths to light in urban city areas,"" he said.
Experts said that while people suffering from asthma may be sensitive to hairs on their wings, the nocturnal creatures do not pose any threat.
""The moths are harmless and the public has nothing to be afraid of,"" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore.
""There is no need for people to protect themselves against these moths as they do not cause any allergies or diseases. In fact, they are important pollinators and are beautiful to watch.""
Many Malaysians and Singaporeans however, took to the internet to share their moth encounters and to upload photographs of the winged creatures.
Although many seemed to welcome the arrival of the furry insects, others remained cautious.
""In China, moths are viewed as symbols of death as they represent the souls of deceased loved ones,"" said Chinese astrologer Cindy Wu.
""It is therefore considered a serious taboo to kill moths or disturb them.""","Swarms of giant moths have descended on Malaysia, invading homes and even disrupting a national football match."
120,"This is according to a study revealing that 96% of the chicks are dying at two to three weeks old.
Conservationists say that human activity has driven the birds to one remaining wetland, but that that site has insufficient food for the ducks.
The research is published in the journal Bird Conservation International.
The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that only 25 individual birds now remain in the wild.
Human activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika.
After the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds.
Dr Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, said that with such a small number of birds, keeping a close eye on the population was straightforward.
""We had about 10 or 11 females, [and] we were able to tell that most of those females were laying eggs, and those eggs were hatching,"" he told BBC News.
But at the point when the ducklings were two to three weeks old, they would start disappearing.
Piecing the evidence together, including samples of food from the bottom of the lake, the researchers realised that the chicks were starving to death.
These diving ducks feed from the bottom of lakes, and this steep crater lake was simply too deep for them.
WWT senior research officer Dr Andrew Bamford, who led the study, said: ""The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the last unspoilt wetlands in the country, but it's simply not suited to its needs.
""Something similar happened in the UK when the lowland red kite became confined to upland Wales, and in Hawaii, where the last nenes survived only on the upper slopes of volcanoes because introduced predators had occupied their favoured grassland habitats.""
Dr Hilton added: ""What we think we're seeing is a bit of a classic wildlife conservation conundrum.
""The place where the species hangs on at the end is not a particularly good place for them - it's just the place that's been least badly affected by human activities.""
But the researchers say the species could thrive in Madagascar again if the captive-bred ducks can be found a new wetland home.
""We have been very successful in establishing a captive population,"" said Dr Hilton.
""And we have recently identified a lake that we think has potential to be restored and become a reintroduction site.
""The main thing we have to do is work with the local people to reintroduce and restore the pochard, but also to restore the lake and help people to get a better livelihood from the lake they live around.""

Rankin (broken leg), Balbirnie (hip) and Thompson (performance anxiety) missed most of Ireland's 2016 campaign.
Niall O'Brien has been left out of the squad with the Ireland selectors opting to take Gary Wilson as the only wicket-keeper while Middlesex seamer Tim Murtagh is also omitted.

122,"Hywel Dda University Health Board wants to reduce the hours of the paediatric ambulatory care unit (PACU) at Withybush Hospital by four hours a day.
It is making a recommendation in response to there being ""fewer consultant paediatricians available.""
The plans will be discussed at a full health board meeting on 24 November.
The PACU cares for children who experience sudden pain, high temperatures, sickness, infections, or requirements for dressings, blood tests, x-rays or scans.
If the recommendation is accepted, it would mean the PACU would be open daily from 10:00 to 1800 GMT instead of 10:00 to 22:00.
Sick children who require assessment after the new closing time would be referred or transferred by ambulance to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.
The health board said the move to reduce hours in the short term was the result of ""longstanding difficulties in recruiting paediatric consultants across the UK"".
This coincided with the retirement of a Pembrokeshire paediatric consultant and the maternity leave of another.
The health board said to do nothing would be a ""risk.""
There is also a recommendation to merge the on-call rota with the one operating in Carmarthenshire.
This means that if there was a paediatric out-of-hours emergency at Withybush Hospital, the on-call paediatric consultants would offer remote advice.
The health board's chief executive Steve Moore said: ""It is our duty to be realistic about the availability of our consultants and to plan care around this so that it is safe, consistent and to avoid public confusion.
""Otherwise, we risk the event of having insufficient staff and having to close the unit in an unplanned and uncoordinated way, risking patient safety and public confidence.""

President: Nursultan Nazarbayev
Politically, Kazakhstan has been dominated since independence in 1991 by former Communist Party chief Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose long authoritarian rule has faced few challenges from weak opposition parties.
Born in 1940, Mr Nazarbayev came to power in 1989 as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and was elected president the following year. He was re-elected after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, and since then another four times - practically unopposed - most recently in 2015.
He remains popular among many ordinary Kazakhs. His supporters say he preserved inter-ethnic accord and stability during the reform in the 1990s, and is widely credited for the country's impressive economic growth in first decade of the new millennium.
Mr Nazarbayev has concentrated extensive powers in his own hands and is accused by the opposition of suppressing dissent. He says democracy is a long-term goal, but that stability could be at risk if change is too swift.
Most media outlets are controlled or influenced by members of the president's family, including his daughter and her husband, and other powerful groups.
Many of the 1,000-plus newspaper titles are government-run and the state controls printing presses.
There are 250 TV and radio stations, according to official figures. The government operates national networks. Russian stations are carried via cable and satellite.
Opposition media outlets faced unprecedented legal pressure in late 2012, seen as linked to their coverage of the deadly 2011 clashes between police and striking oil workers in the city of Zhanaozen.
Late 15th century - With the formation of the Kazakh khanate, the Kazakhs emerge as a distinct ethnic group, but split into three zhuzes (hordes) twi .
1731-42 - Russia establishes control.
1920 - Kazakhstan becomes an autonomous republic - under the misnomer Kirgizstan - following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution and subsequent civil war in Russia.
1936 - Kazakhstan becomes a full union republic of the USSR.
Late 1920s-1930s - Intensive industrialisation and forced collectivisation, which leads to the deaths of more than one million people from starvation.
1954-62 - About two million people, mainly Russians, move to Kazakhstan during Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's campaign to develop virgin lands, lowing the proportion of ethnic Kazakhs to 30%.
1991 December - Nursultan Nazarbayev wins uncontested presidential elections; Kazakhstan declares independence from the Soviet Union.
2011 December - Clashes between striking workers and police in western oil town of Zhanaozen leave 16 people dead.","A huge country the size of Western Europe, Kazakhstan has vast mineral resources and enormous economic potential."

The former Celtic, Aston Villa and Wigan player acknowledged ""it was proving difficult"" to be ""physically 100% able for training and matches"" as he looked to add to his 40 international caps.
Maloney played in both of Scotland's matches in the spring, where he was subbed at half-time in the friendly against Northern Ireland and played the full 90 minutes of the 6-1 win over Gibraltar in Euro 2016 Group D qualifying.
In June, he was back in Scotland for the friendly against Qatar and a few days later played a key role in Scotland's 1-1 draw in the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin.
Earlier this week, he was named in the Scotland squad for next month's Euro qualifiers against Georgia in Tbilisi and Germany at Hampden.
He said of his decision to leave Chicago: ""There were various reasons, a couple of them personal, but once I thought about it professionally, I still had a real desire to achieve something in British football.
""I have loved living in Chicago. I had a brilliant time. I don't think I've been happier living anywhere else.
""The football didn't work out they way we all hoped. The owner, the manager hoped for things to be different.

130,"James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin died when Cheeki Rafiki, the yacht they were sailing, capsized in the North Atlantic.
Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court said yacht manager Douglas Innes failed to get it checked ahead of its trip.
Mr Innes, of Stormforce Coaching, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence.
The 42-year-old, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, also denies a further charge of failing to ensure the vessel was operated in a safe manner.
Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC also outlined to the court how the yacht had been given a category 2 code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a ""safe haven"".
The code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy, he added.
The men were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the vessel overturned in May 2014.
The court heard that after receiving an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht, Mr Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not call the coastguard but instead went to another pub where Mr Bridge phoned saying the situation had worsened.
Mr Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel.
Mr Lickley said it was a ""tragedy"" that they would eventually discover a number of bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht.
He said: ""Some had failed and were broken and had been for some time,"" before the yacht left the UK in October 2013.
Skipper Mr Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, Mr Male, 22, from Romsey, Hampshire, Mr Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Mr Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset, died after the yacht lost its keel more than 700 miles from Nova Scotia in Canada.
The yacht was found by a container ship on 17 May, two days after Mr Bridge's urgent email, with its life raft still on board.
Mr Lickley told jurors the keel's loss would have caused a ""rapid capsize"" and the men on deck would have been ""jettisoned"" into the water while those inside would have been trapped.
He added: ""What is clear from two of the emergency beacons used by Andrew Bridge and James Male is that they may have survived for some time, most probably in the water, that is until they were lost too.""
The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search after two days.
However, following protests from family and friends, and intervention by the British government, it was restarted and the boat was discovered, the court heard.

The record signing will not play in Swansea's season opener at Burnley.
Borja added on Llorente: ""We don't know each other personally but I've been told he's a really good guy.
""I'm sure we'll both work together well and do whatever's best for the team.""
Borja was born in Madrid and came through the academy at Atletico, but has spent the past five seasons on loan away from the Vicente Calderon.
""Of course there's a bit of frustration I didn't play much at Atletico,"" said Borja, who scored 18 goals last season in La Liga for Eibar.
""I grew up there, went through the ranks and wish I'd had more of an opportunity in the first team.""
Despite competition from La Liga and Premier League sides for the Spaniard's signature, Borja says his decision to join Swansea was not difficult.
""Swansea showed the most interest, they seemed to want me more than anyone else,"" he said.
""It's a great club who have a lot of confidence in their players and I really want to make a good impression here.""
Unlike 31-year-old Llorente, who was a part of his Spain's 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012-winning squads, Borja has yet to earn a senior call-up for his country.
But he hopes to emulate ex-Swans striker Michu, who went on to earn a cap for his country after a prolific season with Swansea.
""Michu did a great job at Swansea which eventually earned him a place in Spain's squad,"" said Borja.
""If only I could score as many goals as he did, helping the team in every possible way, for the good of Swansea, but also to put myself in the frame for national selection too.""","New Swansea City signing Borja says ""healthy competition"" with fellow Spanish striker Fernando Llorente will benefit the team."

But the West Midlands team have come a long way since their formation in 1991 and can make history on Saturday by reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time.
It will not be easy against the relative giants of FC United of Manchester but, whatever happens at the Aspray Arena, it will be another chapter in a remarkable story.
Sporting Khalsa are fifth in the Midland League Premier Division, the ninth tier of the English football pyramid. On Tuesday, they won at Brocton. The attendance was 87.
On Saturday, in excess of 2,000 supporters are expected for the visit of National League North side FC United, who play three tiers above Khalsa, in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round.
The winners will earn £12,500 and enter Monday's first-round draw alongside 2008 winners Portsmouth and Wigan, who lifted the trophy by beating Manchester City at Wembley in 2013.
""Preparations started on Sunday because we had to clear an access route for vans to bring in the marquees we are having to use because our bar is not big enough,"" said Inder Grewa, one of Sporting Khalsa's 12 owners, who also acts as treasurer.
""We have never before had to think about marquees because we normally only have 50 people here.
""There was a load of old metal and chairs that needed shifting. Grass verges had to be dug and stone had to be put down to level it off.
""At our level we can't afford to pay people to clear the site. We rely on volunteers.
""We sent one email out and had around 20 people turn up, including the manager and some of the players.""
Prior to this FA Cup run, Sporting Khalsa had never had an attendance in three figures, but there were 750 at the Aspray Arena for the visit of Spalding in the third qualifying round.
On Saturday, a combination of local interest and FC United's healthy away following - many of whom are intent on making a trip to nearby Dudley to see the statue of legendary Manchester United and England player Duncan Edwards - could see three times that many turn up.
Normal home match plans have had to be altered at a club where stadium and bar manager Bal Gacha is the only full-time member of staff.
""We usually print the programmes ourselves on a colour printer,"" Grewa told BBC Sport.
""But we have not been able to do that this weekend because instead of 20 we have had to get a thousand done.
""We have gone up from two stewards to 30.
""We have brought the marquees in because we simply could not accommodate the numbers we are expecting in the bar. Food will be available, though.""
Ah yes, the now famous curry house, located within the 4-4-2 bar adjacent to the ground, open on match and non-matchdays.
""We just thought it would be an add-on,"" said Grewa.
""We feed the players but football comes first. Everything here is working towards improving the football side.""
It is safe to assume neither Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger nor Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood were required for landscaping duties before last season's FA Cup final.
But that was one of the jobs keeping Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe busy this week after answering the call to help create the access route.
Building is nothing new for this Black Country club, sandwiched between Wolverhampton and Walsall, whose story of traversing one side of Noose Lane, where it all began in 1991, to the other, where the Asprey Arena is located, is a compelling one, even if it comes with a sad reminder that some racial stereotypes still run deep.
Sporting Khalsa emerged from a group of a dozen Sikh lads who would meet on Willenhall Memorial Park for a kickabout at weekends.
Playing standards varied. Passion for the game was in them all.
Sporting Khalsa entered the local Walsall and District Sunday League, then moved into Saturday football, pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved.
In 2004 they joined the West Midlands Regional League. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League.
Decisions now, as they always have, are achieved through discussion and consensus, sometimes in the car as they travel to away games.
Sporting Khalsa's architects were Asian. Their official website calls them a semi-professional Asian club.
But it has always been open to all, regardless of religion, skin colour and gender.
They bought a pitch at Bloxwich Town but when Aspray Arena became available after Willenhall Town went into administration in 2009, the opportunity to relocate to a stadium barely 400 yards from the Sunday league pitches where the Sporting Khalsa concept first emerged was too tempting to reject.
""There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club,"" said Grewa.
""We were always aware some of us could not play at a good standard. But we just love the game - and we wanted to see how far we could push ourselves.
""You still get the odd comment. We were at an away match recently and someone said, 'I thought you lot only played cricket', so that stereotype is still there.
""It makes me angry that something like that still happens because it is absolutely not true.
""We just love football. It doesn't matter to us if you are black, green or yellow. We welcome anybody.
""We have kids teams from under-6s upwards and four ladies teams. We are a community club - and the community is everybody.""
The club have ambitions of climbing higher up the football pyramid, but there is also a conflict about how progress could permanently alter the identity of the club.
""We want to get to the National League,"" said Grewa.
""Once you go into the Football League, it becomes a business. I don't know whether we want that.
""The founders of the club have never fallen out. That only happens if there is money involved. As it is, everyone is treated equally.
""Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it.""
At 15:00 BST on Saturday, the dreaming must stop.
By any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team.
They do have an international, central defender Tes Robinson, who plays for St Kitts and Nevis. They also have a forward, Craig Bannister, who has scored nine times in this season's FA Cup.
Saturday's match is Sporting Khalsa's seventh FA Cup tie of the season, more than Arsenal played in lifting the trophy in 2014-15.
The players share lifts to away games. Many still play Sunday football in addition to Saturdays. And it was not known for certain until less than 24 hours before they left for their replay against Spalding last week that their goalkeeper and winger would be able to play because of work commitments.
""I am a Manchester United fan,"" said manager Ian Rowe, who was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season.
""I have followed the FC United story from the start. Next to having my kids, this will be one of the proudest moments of my life.
""But let's not kid ourselves. The chance of us reaching the level we will need to win this game is probably one in a hundred.
""AFC Fylde are in the same league as FC United. They beat a team in our league 9-0. I don't want that to happen to us.""",Sporting Khalsa used to be known locally as the club with a curry house.

134,"In her resignation letter she said her decision would enable her party to have a ""real discussion"" about its future.
Senior party members had ""questioned my place in this new phase"", she said.
Earlier, the 56-year-old said some Labour MPs were ""dinosaurs"" who failed to see ""Scotland has changed forever"".
Ms Lamont had wanted more autonomy for the party in Scotland and significant new powers for the Scottish Parliament.
But in an interview with the Daily Record she accused Westminster colleagues of treating Scotland like a ""branch office"".
Labour has 41 MPs in Scotland who will fight for their Westminster seats at next May's General Election. The party also has 38 MSPs in Edinburgh's Holyrood parliament and they will seek re-election in 2016.
In her resignation letter to Scottish Labour chairman Jamie Glackin Ms Lamont said the referendum had ""opened a new chapter in the debate about the future of the Scottish Labour Party"".
She added: ""In order that we can have the real discussion about how we take Scottish Labour forward, I believe it would be best if I took  myself out of the equation and stepped down as leader.""
She described Labour's challenge in Scotland as ""serious"", but added ""I strongly believe that the Labour Party is not only our best chance of achieving a better, fairer Scotland, it's our only chance"".
There are two versions of this story.  In one version, Scottish Labour's departing leader, Johann Lamont, accuses her Westminster colleagues - and, by implication, Ed Miliband - of undermining her and failing to grasp how much Scotland has changed.  She says some of her MP colleagues are ""dinosaurs"".
The alternative version is that Johann Lamont wasn't up to the job - that she failed to counter the SNP, that she failed to modernise the party sufficiently to cope with a new Scotland where people are no longer prepared to back Labour as a duty, that she failed to attract new talent who might freshen up the party's portrait for the electorate in 2016, when Holyrood goes to the polls.
Reacting to news of the resignation, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Ms Lamont ""carries my personal best wishes"".
But she added: ""There is no question that her shock resignation reveals Labour to be in complete meltdown in Scotland.""
Ms Sturgeon said: ""The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see.""
The timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon.
In the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood.
Whoever replaces her will become Scottish Labour's seventh leader since the Scottish Parliament was established 15 years ago.
Ms Lamont, a former English teacher who joined the Labour Party as a teenager, has represented the Glasgow Pollok constituency at Holyrood since 1999.
She took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP.
In the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister.
Labour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved ""significant credit"" for the successful ""No"" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign.
He added: ""She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom.
""She has led the Scottish Labour Party with determination. I know she will continue to serve her constituents.
""Having elected a new leader, I believe the party will show the same will and determination it did in the referendum campaign to help us to victory in the general election of 2015 and the Scottish elections of 2016.""
Former prime minister Gordon Brown has constantly been linked to the job, as has fellow MP Jim Murphy, who also played a prominent role in the referendum campaign.
Mr Brown said he was sorry to hear that Ms Lamont had resigned.
He added; ""She brought determination, compassion and a down-to-earth approach to the leadership and deserves great credit for taking on the challenge after 2011.
""I wish her well in the future.""
Senior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland.
If the two men refuse another scenario being canvassed is for a joint ticket between the MP Anas Sarwar and the MSP Kezia Dugdale.
Mr Sarwar would be the leader and would seek to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood. Ms Dugdale  would lead the group at Holyrood. One Labour source described this as the ""ideal option"".
Others believe Mr Murphy should be encouraged to stand. One figure said that if ""Jim doesn't stand it will be a disaster"", but added he believed the shadow cabinet member could be persuaded.","Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont has resigned saying senior party members had ""questioned"" her role amid the ""serious challenges"" faced by the party after September's referendum."

A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries.
An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies.
In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company.
Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.
American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.
Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot).
American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket.
2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault.

The programme follows three young people who tell their personal stories about living with grandparents who have dementia.
Dementia is a word that describes a number of symptoms which affect the way the brain thinks. People who suffer from dementia might experience memory loss, have difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or speaking. It is also a progressive disease, which means the symptoms will gradually get worse over time.
One of the stars of the show is Josh, whose granddad has been diagnosed with dementia.
He met up with Richard McCourt, one half of Dick and Dom, about how he coped when his Mum had the disease.
Josh and Richard told us more about what dementia is, and how it affected them.

He only noticed the unfortunate cat after hearing ""meowing"" coming from the walls.
""I couldn't believe it at first,"" said Mr Baird.
He used a drill, chisel and hammer to free Francee before posting a video of the unlikely cat rescue on Facebook in an effort to track down the owner.
The video has since been shared more than 700 times and Francee has been reunited with her owner, a little shocked but uninjured from her ordeal.
According to Mr Baird, the cat got stuck in a tiny cavity space after apparently clambering a ladder to the first floor.
""The only way in would have been from above so she must've climbed up and then got stuck down in between the wall.
""It's fortunate I came up to the house or the cat would not have been found.
""It was a small cavity space in the wall. I was able to pull some of the insulation out and then I got some tools to free her,"" said Mr Baird.
""I'm just happy I was able to get the cat back home again and everything worked out OK.""

139,"Shamsul Arefin brought four people from his native Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel near Appin in Argyll over a three year period.
His victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel. One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt.
Arefin's crimes were  described as a ""clear case of modern day slavery"".
At Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act.
He carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel.
They were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a ""deposit"" in exchange for employment and a salary.
On their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen.
The men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures.
Arefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him.
In one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed.
The crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary.
Responding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: ""Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them.
""Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland.""
Kevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: ""The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past.
""This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial. I hope that receiving justice in the courts assists in their journey of recovery.""
Det Insp Richard Baird from Police Scotland said: ""Shamsul Arefin was driven by financial greed and held no regard for the working conditions of those in his employment.
""This was apparent by the poor condition that his victims were subject to through working long hours at no extra pay and often with substandard equipment and working supplies.
""In bringing this individual to justice we have disrupted, if not dismantled, one more illegal enterprise and hopefully saved other potential victims from inevitable suffering.""",A former hotel owner has been jailed for three years for human trafficking.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said late last month that close to a quarter of those killed were under the age of 18.

Syria: The story of the conflict
Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has consistently denied hitting civilian targets and insists it is battling terrorists.
Mr Valls said his government ""respects Russia and Russia's interests"" but ""that to re-discover the path to peace, to discussion, the Russian bombing of civilians has to stop"".
Mr Kerry again accused Russia of using so-called 'dumb bombs' in Syria that do not hit precise targets. Last week, he said women and children were being killed ""in large numbers"" by Russian raids.
Mr Medvedev said Russia was ""not trying to achieve some secret goals in Syria"", adding that ""we are trying to protect our national interests"".
Their comments were made at a security conference in Munich, days after world powers agreed a deal to push for a cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week.
Agreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved.
Under the plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria.
The halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.
The tentative deal reached here in Munich to pause the fighting in Syria was always going to be a tough sell to the warring parties on the ground. Now its chances of success look even slimmer - ""Forty-nine per cent,"" said Russia's foreign minister. ""Closer to zero,"" said his British counterpart.
For much of the day the Russian and Western ministers have been trading accusations and counter-accusations as to who is to blame for the ongoing misery that is the Syrian civil war.
France, Britain and the US all accused Russia of targeting mainstream rebels and civilians with air strikes while leaving so-called Islamic State largely unscathed. Russia flatly denied this, saying most of those civilians were being besieged by rebels rather than by Assad's forces. Again, Western delegates disagreed.
So there are clearly two, diametrically opposed, versions of what is going on in Syria. That leaves little prospect of the concerted effort for peace by all parties that is so desperately needed.
Rebel groups in Syria have told the BBC they would not stop fighting because they do not believe that Russia will end its bombing campaign in support of the government.
They also reiterated their demand that President Assad be removed from power. On Friday, the president said he wanted to retake ""the whole country"" from rebels.
But US state department spokesman Mark Toner said Mr Assad was ""deluded"" if he thought there was a military solution to the conflict.
Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo.
More than 250,000 people have been killed and some 11 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria.
In another sign of the complexity of the conflict, reports said that on Saturday Turkish forces had shelled Kurdish militia targets in Aleppo provinces.
The Kurdish fighters had seized territory from Islamists in recent days. Turkey views the Kurdish militia as allied to the PKK group, which has a waged a campaign against Turkish security forces for decades.
On Saturday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia would send war planes to the Turkish air base of Incirlik, from where they would attack militants in Syria from the so-called Islamic State.
Saudi Arabia is already part of the international coalition against IS.
Mr Cavusoglu also said it was possible that troops from his country and Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS forces. The US has so far ruled out a ground invasion.
Moscow has warned against any new foreign ground intervention in the country, saying such a development could even lead to a world war.
Why is there a war in Syria?
Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, five years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.
Who is fighting whom?
Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called ""moderate"" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other.
How has the world reacted?
Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.","Pressure is increasing on Russia over civilian deaths in Syria, with France and the US urging greater caution."
142,"Lifelong fan Hearn sold the club to the Italian for £4m in July 2014.
This week the club was served with a winding-up petition from Revenue & Customs for non-payment of tax, with a High Court hearing set for 20 March.
""Looking where we are now, I would never have sold if I had thought this was going to happen,"" Hearn said. ""Hindsight is a wonderful advisor.""
He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""At the time I thought it was perfect for everybody - fans, myself, the club.""
Hearn, who was Orient chairman for 19 years, said when the takeover was completed, he and fans were ""pretty certain"" that Becchetti, who made a fortune in waste management and recycling, would prove to be a good owner.
""He had a very engaging personality,"" the 68-year-old said. ""He seemed passionate about what he wanted to do, and he has done what he told me he was going to do - he has injected many, many millions of pounds into Leyton Orient.
""It is just that putting the money in, and spending it wisely are not always the same things.""
A meeting of the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust (Loft) on Thursday night agreed on what the group calls ""a last-resort measure"" to try to save the relegation-threatened club.
Should Becchetti not pay the tax bill before the court date, then at the winding-up hearing the fans would seek the appointment of an administrator, despite the fact it would mean the club being deducted 12 points under English Football League rules.
An administrator would then look to sell the club as a going concern to a potential new owner.
""That application would be made as late as possible to give the club's current owner time to settle the bill,"" said Loft spokesman Tom Davies.
However, he added that should an adjournment of the court hearing provide a more stable course and future for the club, then they would favour an adjournment.
In addition, Loft has launched a crowd funding page to try to raise £250,000 - reportedly the tax sum owed by the club.
Loft also want to meet Hearn, still the chairman of World Snooker, to discuss its plans for saving the club.
""I have been a bit critical of fans' trusts in the past up and down the country. Some of them have worked, but some of them have been abysmal failures,"" he said.
""But I think they should be encouraged and applauded for looking at the situation. It comes down to what plan they have in their mind, what is the sustainability of the club within that plan and what management, because it is all about management.""
Hearn still owns Orient's Matchroom Stadium. But for that, he believes it could have been sold for redevelopment.
""Fortunately Leyton Orient have got a 20-year lease on the ground, with another 20-year option. I did it on purpose because I could never be 100% sure where I was selling,"" he added.
""I kept the ground to make sure it wasn't used for the wrong reasons - that it wasn't the wrong reasons for buying a football club. Thank goodness I kept it because I would imagine now, with the situation it is, developers would be knocking on the door tomorrow.""
When asked by BBC Sport, Leyton Orient declined to respond to Hearn's remarks or comment on Loft's proposals.",Former Leyton Orient owner Barry Hearn says he now regrets selling the club to businessman Francesco Becchetti.
143,"In the press release for the new record The Systems Are Failing, the musician writes: ""We're destroying the world, and we're still miserable. Fat, sick, stupid and anxious are no ways to live.
""These systems are failing. Let them fail. Change or die.""
What makes this different from a Moby album?
I think a lot of people think of me as making sort of down-tempo quiet, electronic living room music and this record is much more of a fast, aggressive post-punk record and, based on the reactions I've had so far, people have been a little nonplussed at that.
What reactions specifically? Do people think you're crazy or are they applauding a brave new direction?
Both in equal measure, part of what led me to want to make a record like this, is the awareness that people don't really buy records any more and people especially don't buy records from 51-year-old musicians who are making their 15th record, so with those two things in mind there's also a sense of emancipation that comes with that.
You can either bemoan the fact that, in 2016 the audience for albums is quite small, but I see it as being really liberating because there's no external pressure at all. I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting.
You've been very commercially successful and some might say that puts you in the privileged position of not having to worry about it.
Yes and it would be hard for me to argue that. I would feel absurdly presumptuous criticising anyone else's choices, there are a lot of musicians who have children or alimony payments or sick relatives, so they need to make commercial compromises in order to pay the rent. I'm lucky because I live a relatively simple life and I can make whatever music I want to make without any worry about any commercial ramifications.
In your mission statement for this project you state: 'When some of my middle-aged compatriots try to accommodate the pop market place, the results are so anodyne and depressing'. Did you have someone specific in mind?
I did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But the truth is that a majority of musicians as they age don't do so in a graceful way. What I mean by that is, I understand that as you age, you want to hold on to your glory days and for most musicians that was decades ago, so you find yourself dressing the same way and touring and taking out your contact lenses so the audience will be blurry and look bigger than it is.  If I don't have to go down that route, I'd just as soon not.
But your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do?
I have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit.
I own a restaurant in LA and 100% of the profits goes to animal welfare charities and my only show this year is a fundraiser for an animal rights group. I don't mean that in a self-congratulatory way, I just mean my criteria has changed. How do my choices benefit the causes that I care about? So, if an advertiser came to me with a dump truck full of money to license a song, I would probably say ""yes"" and simply direct the dump truck to one of the organisations I work with.
I've always tried to employ that ethos when it comes to advertising,  like ""rob from the rich and give to the poor"" or, more accurately, ""take from corporations and give to those who work against those corporations"". But even when I was being crucified for that, I really didn't want to talk about it because it seemed defensive. It made me uncomfortable trying to justify myself even if there was justification there.
With that and the Pacific Void manifesto, it sounds like you're having a conscientious mid-life crisis but, instead of buying a sports car, you're trying to right the world's wrongs.
I've always been potentially an annoying, opinionated loudmouth. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. There's so much, especially in the public arena, of this shameless, endless self-promotion that it just makes me nauseous.
I don't want to be like them, there are too many horrifying pressing issues. Just putting out a new fashion line or lending your name to a perfume company would be fine if the world wasn't an inch away from catastrophe.
Is this your main creative drive now or will you go back to recording under Moby?
I made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name. But the truth is that it's me on my own so if I go back and record something under my name, it all seems kind of arbitrary to me.
Do you intend on touring the new album?
Dear God no. It's another thing that's emancipating . Most musicians put out a record with the intent of touring and my intention is to never tour again as long as I live because I hate touring. I love playing music but going to the same airports and the same hotels and the law of diminishing returns, as you age you play smaller venues and you try and play new songs but the audience just want to hear the hits which I understand because when I go to see middle-aged musicians, I want to see the hits.
But if I never ever go on tour again, I would be very happy.
Have you said everything you need to with this album?
I've already made the follow-up record, I'm just trying to figure out when my record label will let me release it. Part two is all ready to go but clearly record companies don't love middle-aged musicians who refuse to tour, so I can't be too haughty and high-handed with them. I have to rely on their good graces.

144,"The Bacc was introduced about a decade ago to offer a more rounded education.
Researchers at Cardiff University found students were 15% less likely to achieve a first or 2:1 degree.
The Welsh government said the Bacc will be more rigorous from September 2015, and it will address many findings in the report, which it commissioned.
The Welsh Bacc brings together traditional qualifications like GCSEs and A-levels with the Bacc ""core,"" comprised of a range of modules including team enterprise activities, community participation and Wales' place in Europe and the world.
There are currently more than 78,000 learners registered on Welsh Baccalaureate courses studying at more than 250 schools and other institutions.
""Participation and progress are kind of connected,"" Prof Chris Taylor from Cardiff University, a co-author of the report, told BBC Radio Wales.
""On the one hand you'll find that students are significantly more likely to get into university with the Welsh Baccalaureate. Crucially, they are more likely to get into a leading Russell Group university, which is very good news.
""However that seems to come at the expense then in terms of their successes of degree outcomes.
""Although we find significant results, it does appear that students without the Welsh Baccalaureate are more likely to get a first or a 2:1.""
He added: ""The number of students who are not likely to get a good degree isn't as significantly as large as we first thought.""
Prof Taylor said the Welsh Bacc's success in terms of getting students into university ""far outweighs"" the disadvantages found in terms of their results.
But he said: ""We do make the recommendation that it could be more challenging. It could be more tailored to the particular needs of the students in terms of their choice of subjects at university they're going to study.
""We also recognise there needs to be greater support for the qualification because it has some added value.
""There are clearly some benefits to some students in terms of essay writing skills, in terms of time management and independent learning that most other qualifications don't offer.
""But it doesn't translate in terms of degree results and that may be because it's at the expense of subject knowledge which is missing.""
""On the one hand it's a core qualification that every student should undertake and it provides a set of core skills that everybody like employers, labour markets and higher education universities can understand is there but at the same time it's got to be challenging, got to be tailored to the individual needs of students.
""That challenge is very difficult for sixth forms and FE colleges.""
Last year, a study by the Welsh Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) also suggested undergraduates completing the Welsh Bacc fare less well at university than those who have not.
The Welsh government said the research by Cardiff University was commissioned to help with the development of the Welsh Bacc.
A spokesperson added: ""Our independent review of qualifications addressed many of the findings in the WISERD report, and we are already taking action to deliver the review's recommendations regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate.
""As a result, we are working towards delivering a more rigorous Welsh Baccalaureate to be taught from September 2015.
""This will provide further assurance to higher education institutions about the ability of Welsh Baccalaureate learners and will help university admissions tutors make offers to prospective learners.""","University students who studied the Welsh Baccalaureate are less likely to get higher degrees than those who did not, a report suggests."
145,"The 14-time major champion, who has twice undergone surgery during 15 months out, is nine shots off the pace set by fellow American JB Holmes.
Woods, 40, had four birdies in eight holes but he bogeyed the ninth after a wayward drive and poor chip.
Another shot went on the 11th, while double bogeys on the 16th and 18th left the world number 898 a stroke over par.
Woods said he ""felt pretty good"" and ""looking forward to the next few days"" after completing his round at the event he hosts to benefit his charitable foundation.
""I hit the ball in three bushes and the water, so it could have been something really good,"" he said on Sky Sports.
""I got off to a solid start but then I made a few mistakes. I didn't play the par fives particularly well. ""I had some awkward shots.  If you drive great you can take advantage of this golf course, but if you don't you can end up in bushes or rocks and go sideways.""
His first double bogey came after he pulled his approach to the green from the centre of the 16th fairway and was forced to chip out short of the green. He over-hit his fourth and two putted from the back edge for a six.
Woods then pulled his drive on the par-four 18th into a lake and although he hit the pin with his fourth shot, he two-putted from 12 feet for the fourth six of his round.
He had briefly tied for the lead at four under after a run of three birdies from the sixth hole as he played the first nine holes in three-under-par 33.
And although he cancelled out his bogey on the 11th with a birdie on the 15th, his two late double bogeys blotted an otherwise encouraging round.
Holmes leads the 18-man event after an eight-under-par 64 that featured seven birdies and an eagle.

Is populism a threat to Europe's economies?
The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but a victory for the Freedom Party could have been a springboard for success in the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2018.
Correspondents say the legal challenge threatens to renew divisions created by the vote, which split Austria and exposed, once again, deep differences in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis, the economy and how to balance national interests against those of the EU.
Mr Van der Bellen was declared the winner of the election the day after voting, with 50.3% of the vote against Mr Hofer's 49.7% - despite preliminary results placing the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer slightly ahead.
But the Freedom Party is alleging numerous irregularities in its 150-page submission to the constitutional court.
Mr Strache says he has filed evidence that postal ballots were illegally handled in 94 of 117 district election offices, reports said, suggesting that more than 570,000 ballots could have been affected by this.
The party also claims it has evidence that under-16s and foreigners were allowed to vote.
""The extent of irregularities is more than terrifying. That's why I feel obliged to challenge the result,"" Mr Strache told a news conference.
""You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to have a bad gut feeling about this whole election. Without these irregularities Mr Hofer could have become president.""
The BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna says that if the constitutional court accepts the evidence presented by Mr Strache, there could be several possible outcomes, including a partial recount or a fresh vote in affected areas.
But the court will have to decide whether the law was broken and whether any possible breaches would have affected the outcome of the election.","Austria's far-right Freedom Party has lodged a legal challenge to the result of last month's presidential election, which it lost by a tiny margin."

Political expert Dr Adrian Lee said the dual role was unique to the islands.
He said they were the only democratic jurisdictions in the world where the person judging a case had been involved in making the law.
The Carswell Committee, which authored the report, suggested Jersey's Bailiff should step down as president of the States of Jersey and be replaced by an elected speaker.
Lord Carswell said: ""There are various international constitutional documents, which rather frown on the idea of judges having anything to do with the legislator.""
He said there was also a practical reason, as in recent years the Jersey Bailiff had had to spend increasing amounts of time on States work.
Dr Lee, a former professor of politics at Plymouth University, said: ""The Carswell Committee also made the point that as the two islands increasingly develop their international personalities, as they're called, it's important that their legal systems and political systems are clear to the outside world.

But in recent months, the rebels have driven government forces out of several areas in the countryside to the north, as well as almost all of the neighbouring province of Idlib.
More than 230,000 people are believed to have been killed in Syria since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. Some 11.5 million others - more than half of the country's population - have fled their homes.
Rebels have made numerous attempts to seize key installations held by the government, but with little effect.
On Thursday, 13 Islamist fighting groups and al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, came together to launch a co-ordinated assault on several fronts.
A statement said the aim of the new coalition, called Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law), was ""the liberation of Aleppo and its countryside"", after which they would work with other groups to govern the city according to Islamic law.
Western-backed groups also said they were taking part in the offensive, organised through a joint operations room called Fatah Halab (Conquest of Aleppo), the New York Times reported.
The rebels launched simultaneous attacks on western districts of the city controlled by government forces, firing hundreds of rockets and shells, the Syrian Observatory reported.
The offensive unleashed on government-held western Aleppo by Ansar al-Sharia seems to be the most serious since the battle for Aleppo began.
An early test of its prospects will be one of the first apparent objectives - the loathed and feared Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Zahra, on the western edge of the city. Rebels have tried many times to capture it, and failed.
The offensive has been building up for some time, following the capture of Idlib by a newly-coalesced rebel alliance, Jaish al-Fatah (Victory Army), in March.
What's making the difference is that rebel groups, and their outside backers like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which were competing in the past, now seem to be pulling together - bad news for the regime.
The success of the new campaign may depend on whether Damascus is seriously determined to hang on to Aleppo. If it is, rebel progress will be slow and hard.
The UK-based group said the fighting continued into the early hours of Friday and was focused on the frontline in Zahra, a heavily-defended area that houses several major security compounds.
At least nine people were killed and dozens wounded by the rebel barrage, it added.
The military responded with a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of rebel positions in the city, and the fighting continued for several hours.
On Friday morning, military sources told Sana and Reuters news agency that the assault had been repelled and that heavy casualties had been inflicted on the rebels.
The Syrian Observatory said the rebels had managed to seize some buildings in the north-western outskirts of Aleppo, but that the gains were not of strategic importance.
The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the rebels do manage to capture all Aleppo, it would be a huge blow to the government.
There have been persistent reports in recent weeks that it is preparing to give up both the northern city, and Deraa in the south, the better to defend the core areas of western Syria with the limited manpower at its disposal, he adds.
But state media reported that the prime minister has just been in Aleppo, visiting front-line units and dispensing large amounts of cash to the city authorities for reconstruction and administrative expenses.",The Syrian military has carried out a series of air strikes after rebel forces launched a major assault to take control of the northern city of Aleppo.

151,"The official ONA news agency said they were flown on Wednesday out of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthi rebel movement.
The US government had requested Oman's help in finding them, it added.
The ministry gave no details on the Americans' identities, but one Yemeni security official told the Reuters news agency had been held by the rebels.
""The three Americans were detained by the security forces run by the Houthis and were held on suspicion of spying,"" the official said by telephone from Sanaa.
Earlier this month, the US state department said an American contractor for the United Nations who was detained at Sanaa's airport last month had died.
John Hamen and a colleague - reportedly also American - were held as they arrived on a UN aircraft from Djibouti.
In September, two Americans held hostage for months by the Houthis were freed and flown to safety in Oman, along with a British citizen and three Saudis.
The rebels, who ousted Yemen's government from Sanaa this year, are facing an air and ground campaign by a multinational coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the US.
Oman, which is not part of the coalition, has played an active role in efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict.
The fighting has left at least 5,700 people dead, about half of them civilians, since the end of March, the UN says.","Three US citizens have been evacuated from Yemen by the Omani air force, Oman's foreign ministry says."
152,"It has been waiting on a review of the Russian Proton rocket, which failed on its last outing in May while carrying a Mexican payload.
Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform was due to be the next passenger and was grounded as a consequence.
The launch on the Proton is now set for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
Lift-off will be at 17:44 local time (12:44 BST).
Inmarsat is the world's largest mobile satellite services operator.
Its principal customer base is the shipping sector, but the company also caters for any groups that need telecommunications away from a fixed line. These include oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones.
Its new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now.
It is designed to incorporate three spacecraft distributed around the globe to give worldwide coverage.
Two have already gone up, to relay telecommunications from Asia all the way across to the Americas.
The upcoming launch should complete the network over the Pacific, and give customers seamless coverage wherever they are - something that is especially important to the shipping and aviation sectors.
Investigators are now confident they understand the loss of May's Proton.
The natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine.
The disruption ultimately broke an oxidizer line and led to the pump shutting down, and the loss of the engine.
Measures have been put in place to make sure this cannot happen again.
The Proton has had a torrid record of late.
Six vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced.
""The return to flight is typically the best flight to be on because there is extra caution, extra controls,"" Michele Franci, Inmarsat's Chief Technical Officer, told BBC News.
The new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month.
Global Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications.
Traditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band.
The higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft.
""If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,"" said Mr Franci
""So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable. But we could definitely have done without the delays, that's for sure.""

153,"Alonso's win moved him into third in the standings, 17 points behind leader Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull, who is four ahead of Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen.
""We have a competitive package, especially on Sundays,"" Alonso said.
""We need to make it a little faster on Saturdays. We are working on that but it is looking good.""
The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment
Alonso qualified only fifth in Spain but fought through to win after moving up to third on the first lap and then using an aggressive four-stop strategy that allowed him to exploit the Ferrari's race pace.
It was his second victory of the year, to follow on from a win in China last month, and he finished second to Raikkonen in Australia, the only other race in which he has not had problems.
In Malaysia, he damaged his front wing in a collision with Vettel on lap one and then retired when it broke after he did not come in to change it.
In Bahrain, he finished eighth after problems with his DRS overtaking aid.
Alonso said: ""We have only had five races in the championship. In these five races, we have nearly two retirements and without this we were maybe leading now a little comfortably.
""So what we need to do is have consistent podium results for the next four or five races and that will bring us a lot of points to put in the pocket.""
Alonso had a scare when one of his tyres got a puncture before his final pit stop, but the team were able to bring him in two laps earlier than planned to avoid a problem.
""We decided to play safe after Malaysia, where we were a little bit brave trying to do one extra lap with the front wing broken and we crashed in that lap.
""Here it could have affected the strategy because it was stopping too early, but it was OK and didn't affect the result.""
The victory was Alonso's third in his home country, following his 2006 Spanish Grand Prix win for Renault and last year's victory in the European Grand Prix in Valencia.
He was cheered by the packed grandstands and afterwards paid tribute to the fans, making a reference to the troubled economic situation in Spain as a result of the Eurozone crisis.
""It is fantastic,"" he said. ""Winning at home is always like you did it for the first time. It is the third time for me but each time is always different, like a new experience.
""The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment, so I'm happy for them and thanks to them for the support.""
Raikkonen finished runner-up to Alonso, his third second place in a row, and said: ""We are here to try to win races and championships. I want to win; the team wants to win.
""It's disappointing to finish second but if anything we gained some points on Sebastian today so something good came out of today.
""It helps if you cannot win to be second but I don't think it is enough in the long run. We have to keep finishing higher up and when we have a bad day try to make the best out of them and try to minimise them.""
Vettel finished fourth for the second time this season, beaten to the final podium spot by Ferrari's Felipe Massa.
""I wouldn't talk about frustration,"" said Vettel, who has taken two wins and a third place in the other two races this season.
""We still finished fourth and got some good points, we wanted more but we just didn't have the tyres to fight with the guys in front. We can be happy with fourth.""",Ferrari's Fernando Alonso said after winning the Spanish Grand Prix that he was confident of making a strong world title challenge this year.

The statement prompted many questions online about how they came to be driving the cars.

Workers could be seen clearing up debris strewn across the road.
The cause of the crash is not clear, but police are investigating. Witnesses told local media that the tunnel was often used for drag racing.

157,"Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century.
It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates.
They are part of a project to redevelop the opencast mine as Glenmuckloch Energy Park.
The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.
Buccleuch Estates has joined with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to draw up the plans.
It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine.
The report states: ""When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-turbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the upper pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the pump-turbines reverse and change to generating mode with water released from the upper pond.""
If the project goes ahead, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while a second, upper pond will be excavated at the head of Halfmerk Hill.
The higher reservoir will have a water depth of 22m (72 feet), creating 3.3million cubic metres of water storage.
The redevelopment of Glenmuckloch follows the collapse of surface mining firm Aardvark TMC in 2013, leaving a shortfall in the money needed to restore the site to its pre-opencast condition.
However since then Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have worked to implement a rolling programme of restoration in parallel with coaling operations.
Later this summer two community wind turbines will be built to the west of the hydro site.
Earlier this year plans for an eight turbine wind farm next to the mine were submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.",Plans to build a major hydro scheme on the site of an opencast mine in the south of Scotland have been revealed.
158,"Our part of the country has long been a two-party affair to a greater extent than anywhere else in the country, so a straightforward device pointing this way and then that was almost invariably quite good enough to do the job.
But what, I ask myself, would we need to visualise the infinite variety of 2015?
The best idea I have managed to come up with so far goes like this.
Imagine you suspend a needle from a thread above a table on which you position magnets of varying strengths and political colours in a circle.
They symbolise the interactions between the parties in each constituency.
Lower the needle towards the centre of the table and see which way it points. [Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]
But the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.
In this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.
Take for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.
In the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.
In 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.
Solihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.
Extreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.
Like a collection of by-elections perhaps?
That may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.
And what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?
Or, about those ""percentage swing to win or lose"" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?
All it tells us is how little they tell us.
""Never assume"" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud.
In an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro.
In this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all?",Only people with long memories have clear recollections of simpler times when Professor Robert McKenzie's swingometer could tell the story of successive general elections.
159,"East Sussex Healthcare Trust which runs the Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital is currently rated as ""inadequate"".
However, BBC South East Today has learned the trust has failed to improve and is likely to be placed into special measures at a meeting on Friday.
The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment.
The other trusts currently in special measures include East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust.
Medway's Maritime Hospital was forced to turn away ambulances earlier, and on Wednesday, to help ease the burden on its A&E department.
The East Sussex trust was rated as ""inadequate"" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March, after failing to meeting government targets.
In May, it was criticised by Eastbourne Borough Council, which passed a vote of no confidence in its management.
And in July the chief executive resigned while the trust had to apologise after patients' details were found in the street.
Leadership would appear to be the big problem at this trust. In its March report, the CQC described a ""disconnect between the trust board and it's staff"" and a ""culture where staff were afraid to speak out"".
The trust's problems have been well documented but what has apparently been lacking is any real progress in putting things right.
It's my understanding the CQC feel very little has improved in the last few months.
Friday's meeting between all the stakeholders will be a chance to discuss the way forward but many people I have spoken to in the wider NHS believe special measures will be imposed on the trust.
A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether it would be put into special measures.
He said: ""We are waiting for the publication of the CQC report next week and until it is published and they have made any recommendation we are unable to make any further comment.""","A third hospital trust in the South East is expected to be put into special measures, the BBC understands."
160,"The Conservative leader said a future government led by him would build 100,000 new homes for such people.
They would be built on brownfield land already identified for development and exempt from some taxes, he said.
He was speaking as the party prepares for its annual conference this weekend.
Conservative politicians and activists will gather in Birmingham from Sunday for what is the final conference before next May's general election.
Unveiling the pledge - an extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme - Mr Cameron said the Conservatives wanted more young people to ""achieve the dream"" of owning their own home.
""I want young people who work hard, who do the right thing, to be able to buy a home of their own. So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value.
""They can't be bought by foreigners, they can't be bought by buy-to-let landlords, they can't be flipped round in a quick sale. They can only be bought by hard working people under the age of 40.""
The starter homes plan would apply only to England, whereas Help to Buy is UK-wide.
That scheme entails the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build properties.
Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said Mr Cameron had presided over the lowest level of house building in peacetime since the 1920s.
""After four and a half years he now tells us that he is going to deliver for first-time buyers but under his government a record one in four young people are living at home with their parents and young people across the country are priced out of home ownership.
""Labour will make the fundamental changes to the market which are urgently needed and will double the number of first-time buyers in the next 10 years.""
Campbell Robb, of homelessness charity Shelter, welcomed the pledge but said it was ""absolutely vital"" that the homes built were ""genuinely affordable for young couples and families on ordinary incomes"".
""There's a real concern that removing the requirement on developers to build affordable housing means this policy may not help those facing the greatest struggle to get a home of their own,"" he said.
Grainia Long, of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said she welcomed ""the focus on supply and affordability"" but still had ""some serious concerns"".
She said: ""This smacks of building for one group of people at the expense of another.
""Social housing is critical if we are going to solve the housing crisis - there are always going to be people who can't afford to buy and we must provide decent, affordable homes for them too.
""Equally, we'd like to see more investment in shared ownership to help people on lower incomes. If all the focus is on home ownership, we are never going to build mixed communities.""
Under the new proposals, the homes would be built on brownfield land which was no longer needed for industrial or commercial use.
Savings from using such land would be passed on to the buyers, the Conservatives said.
Public sector land would also be used to deliver the pledge.
The homes would be exempt ""from a raft of taxes"", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development.
Some building regulations - including the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units.
The zero carbon homes standard, which applies from 2016, aims to improve energy efficiency.
It requires house builders to decrease all carbon emissions from energy arising from fixed heating and lighting, hot water and other fixed building services - such as ventilation - in new homes.","First-time buyers in England under the age of 40 could buy a house at 20% below the market rate if the Conservatives are re-elected, David Cameron has pledged."
161,"The biggest Commons clash is likely to be over Sunday trading  - where a well organised group of Tory rebels looks set to line up with Labour, to try to strike down proposals to loosen restrictions. The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.
Elsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords ""ping-pong"" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
The Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.
Then it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:
In the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the ""Work Related Activities Group"", and content themselves with a ""regret"" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another ""regret motion"" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.
And that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.
He says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.
After that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.
And there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.
There will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.
In Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.
And at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a Â£1bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a Â£20bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.
In the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.
Then peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.
The sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.
There will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.
The Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's ""engine room,"" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.
Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.
She has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.
Then MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.
Labour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.
The day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).
In the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.
The really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.
There will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).
The Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.
This will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the ""check-off"" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.
The various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.
The Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.
Then MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.
The decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.
In the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on ""pay to stay"" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).
There will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.
The Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.
But the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.
His close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.
For the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).
There are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.
It's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list.","I'm not sure we're quite into ""zombie Parliament"" territory, but there's a distinct lull in Westminster this week, as major events like the Budget and the Investigatory Powers Bill, loom on the horizon."
162,"Lisa Doughty, who has mesothelioma, was a pupil at Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London in the 1980s.
The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles.
Hackney Council said it had not received a formal claim and could not investigate until it did.
Ms Doughty said she had spent a lot of time in the music room each week rehearsing plays.
""We used to sit on the desks and have to wipe white dust off them,"" she said.
""There were two heavy doors at the entrance to the music room and these would constantly slam, shaking the room. The school was in pretty bad repair so maybe the dust came down from the ceiling when the door closed.""
Ms Doughty said if it was proved the music room was the cause of her cancer, then it was ""possible that many others have been affected"".
""I wanted to raise awareness of this and to appeal for anyone else who has been affected, pupils or teachers, to get in touch.""
Ms Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have found that asbestos ceiling tiles were in place during the time that she was a pupil at the school.
They are considering taken further legal action.
A Hackney Council spokesman said: ""Asbestos was historically used extensively in both public and private buildings due to its fire retardant properties and, as with any building of this age, Haggerston School has been subject to regular condition and asbestos surveys and removals.""
Edmund Young, an asbestos-related disease specialist at the law firm, said: ""Mesothelioma is traditionally a form of cancer that has affected those working in industrial jobs, but we are seeing more and more people - both teachers and former pupils - coming to us who have breathed in asbestos particles while at school.""",A mother-of-three who believes she was exposed to asbestos as a schoolgirl has been diagnosed with a cancer often related to the toxic substance.

Henry, who has won eight caps for Ireland as well as playing 109 times for Ulster, is hoping to win a trophy with the province after defeats in the Heineken Cup final and Pro12 final in the past two seasons.

164,"Northern Ireland's McIlroy, twice a winner in seven US PGA starts, bogeyed the last for a one-under 69 to finish three over and miss the cut by one.
American Walker also bogeyed the 18th for a 66 and nine-under total, matched by Streb who birdied his last for 63.
Defending champion Jason Day had eight birdies in a 65 to get to seven under.
The Australian world number one is tied third with Argentina's Emiliano Grillo (67), while Open winner Henrik Stenson of Sweden is one shot back after carding a second three-under 67 to move to six under.
Germany's Martin Kaymer (69), who won this tournament in 2010, and Americans Patrick Reed (65) and Brooks Koepka (67) are four adrift on five under.
Wales' Jamie Donaldson (67) is the highest-placed Briton at the final major of the season on four under, one ahead of world number three Jordan Spieth, who also shot 67.
With the cut mark hovering between one and two over par, McIlroy, who holed a 30-foot putt on the 17th to get to two over, thought he needed another birdie on the last.
The four-time major winner hit his second on the par-five 18th into greenside rough and took three more shots to get on the green before holing out for a bogey.
""I thought I needed to make four, so that's what I was trying to do,"" said the 2012 and 2014 US PGA champion.
""It was a tough lie. I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.""
The world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were ""pathetic"".
""Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,"" he said.
""My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that. It's pretty solid. If you had given anyone else in this field my tee shots this week, they would have been up near the top of the leaderboard.
""It just shows you how bad I was around the greens.""
The Swede was grouped with the year's other two major winners - Masters champion Danny Willett and US Open victor Dustin Johnson - and he outscored them on both days.
He dropped to one under par after three-putt bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes but a three-foot eagle putt on the par-five 18th, his ninth, followed by three birdies on the front nine, moved him one clear of the field.
""I got off to a bit of a wobbly start and stood over a six-foot putt on the 14th to avoid going three over, so I'm quite happy that went in and I turned it on from 18,"" said the 40-year-old, who won his first major at Royal Troon two weeks ago.
""That could easily have gone the wrong way but I was hanging in there and got the good stuff coming in.""
Willett birdied the ninth to card a 70 and make the cut on one over, but pre-tournament favourite Johnson is going home after adding a 72 to his opening 77 for a nine-over total.
Neither American has never won a major and while Walker has five victories on the PGA Tour, Streb has just one and has missed nine cuts in 23 events in 2016.
Walker, 37, made a solid start to round two with two birdies and seven pars in his opening nine holes before moving clear of the field with a run of three successive birdies from the 12th.
He pulled his tee shot on the 17th into a hospitality area and escaped with a free drop and par five but an almost identical shot on the last was not so lucky, ending up in a lake and resulting in a dropped shot.
""The finish wasn't what I was looking for, but it's fine,"" said Walker. ""I think you take 66 at any tournament all day every day. So it's good.
""I will watch the leaderboard on Saturday. I don't think that's a big deal. I enjoy watching it. I think you need to know where you are at.""
Streb started on the 10th and had four birdies and a bogey in his opening nine holes and closed with three in four holes to become the 30th player to card a 63 in a major - no player has ever shot a 62.
The 29-year-old, who missed the cut at each of the first three majors of 2016, said he turned up this week ""just to see if I could play some good golf and have fun"".
He added: ""Obviously it's going pretty well, but my expectations are pretty low, which maybe is a good thing.""
Day was Friday's other big mover, knocking in seven birdies in eight holes from the eighth to sit two off the lead.
""I kind of gave myself a little bit of a kick up the bum with the double bogey on seven,"" he said.
""It was a bit of a mess but to come back and birdie eight and nine made things a lot better for me on the back nine.""
Former world number one and two-time major winner Spieth had five birdies in his opening nine holes to get to four under par but missed several opportunities to better his score on his back nine, while a bogey saw him close on three under.
""It was a really solid round and I'm back in contention,"" said the American. ""I'm hitting the ball fantastic. I just can't get a putt to go in from beyond 10 feet.""
Kaymer, who started at four under, began the front and back nines with bogeys but three birdies in his last four holes lifted him to five under.
""I made a few putts here and there. I enjoyed the last few holes,"" he said. ""It was important for me to finish the way I did.""
Andrew Johnston continued to impress in the majors, after finishing tied for eighth at The Open, with a one-under-par 69 to reach halfway at one under.
The Englishman, better known by his nickname 'Beef', started on the 10th and was two under after nine holes. He dropped back to level with bogeys on the fifth and seventh holes, but he then birdied the eighth.
""Every hole, man, I get so many nice comments,"" said the 27-year-old. ""Even after the fifth hole, when I three-putted, they are like, 'Don't worry, Beef, come on, bounce back, you've got this one'. And it's just nice, man. It's a nice atmosphere.""
Lee Westwood (70) hit 92% of greens in regulation as he also finished on one under, alongside fellow Englishmen Ross Fisher (73) and Tyrrell Hatton (68).
Andy Sullivan, who reached five under, dropped away with six bogeys in nine holes through the middle of his round before finishing birdie-eagle on the two par-five finishing holes to post a 71 and a two-under total that matched Paul Casey (69).

166,"David Anderson QC said his ""central concern"" about the proposals first unveiled by David Cameron in early September was: ""Where are the courts?""
Temporary Exclusion Orders are one of the measures in the counter terrorism bill published by Theresa May.
It also includes tougher powers to stop people going abroad to fight.
It will include plans to stop some British citizens returning to the UK, and others from leaving the country.

Analysis by Political Correspondent Robin Brant
The government proposes the law, parliament passes it, then David Anderson reviews it - and sometimes makes recommendations. That's the usual sequence of events.
But today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published.
The QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September.

Mrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a ""greater"" terror threat than ever before.
The measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted.
But campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties.
'A more sensible way'
Mr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was ""nothing like as dramatic"" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year.
He told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as ""an announcement waiting for a policy"".
But he said it soon became clear such a move would ""neither legally or practically"" work and the current plan was now much ""closer to managed return"".
He argued there could be ""a more sensible"" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.
""One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,"" he said.
""Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station?
The new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes:
""They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process.""
Mr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves.
""But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,"" he said.
""The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this?
""If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so.
""One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes.
""If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised.""
Mr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day.
'Changing threats'
The UK's terror threat level remains ""severe"" after it was upped from ""substantial"" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.
Speaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: ""We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.
""This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves.""
The government wants to ""fast-track"" the bill through Parliament, citing the need to tackle the direct threat posed by the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) and the increasing number of Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight on its behalf.
But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said more was needed to be done to stop British citizens from being radicalised and to deal with any threat this posed to national security.
Amnesty International called the powers ""draconian"", adding none of the measures seemed ""properly thought through"".
And Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: ""Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.""
The Home Office says communications data has played a major role in ""every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade"" but gaps in the UK's access to such information need to be filled.
Mrs May has warned that even the new data retention powers will not fully address the threat, reiterating the need for a Communications Data Bill to bring in more wide-ranging web monitoring powers.
That bill - labelled a snooper's charter by critics - was scrapped following Lib Dem opposition.
Technology firms said there had been insufficient consultation on the more limited proposals in the bill requiring firms to keep information to help the authorities to match internet protocol (IP) addresses to an individual user or a device.
The Home Office said it had met internet service providers and other groups to discuss the measures but the Internet Services Providers Association said there had been ""a distinct lack of engagement"" with the industry.
Ministers want to amend legislation passed earlier this year to require firms to retain data, including that ""required to identify the sender or recipient of a communication, the time or duration of a communication, the type, method or pattern of communication and the telecommunications system used"".
However, the bill stresses that the content of messages and details that would ""explicitly identify"" what websites someone had visited would not have to be stored.
On Tuesday a report into last year's killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby raised questions about whether social network providers should have to report details of extremist activity.
David Cameron said companies had a ""social responsibility"" to act on terrorist material posted online after the report detailed how Michael Adebowale, one of two men convicted of Mr Rigby's murder, spoke on Facebook about wanting to murder a soldier.
Facebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it.",Concerns about plans to exclude people from the UK if they go abroad to fight with extremist groups have been raised by the UK's reviewer of terror laws.
167,"The area near the main administrative block of JNU is filled with passionate students.
They cheer loudly as a speaker climbs on to a stage.
Slogans like ""free Kanhaiya Kumar"" and ""long live revolution"" fill the air as hundreds of visibly agitated students pour into the area.
Those gathered here believe that Mr Kumar, the leader of the university's student union, is innocent of the sedition charges levelled against him, and are shocked by the fact that police entered the university to arrest him on Saturday.
Police have alleged he organised an event commemorating the hanging of 2001 Parliament attacks convict Afzal Guru, where ""anti-India slogans"" were raised.
The students here passionately defend Mr Kumar when I ask them what actually happened at the event.
""We are not terrorists. We are just students and we also condemn anti-India slogans. Our president had nothing to do with those slogans at the event,"" a student tells me.
But she refuses to speak on camera.
""I don't want to be seen on camera. I am worried about my safety,"" she says.
Student activist Shreya Ghosh speaks of the fear prevailing inside the university.
""We have been sleeping in different rooms every night to avoid arrest,"" she says.
Another student activist Deepshita claims that ideological politics lies at the heart of Mr Kumar's arrest.
""Right-wing students want to increase their foothold in the university and that is why they got him [Mr Kumar] arrested. They feel bolstered because the right-wing BJP party is in power at the centre,"" she says.
Professor Rajarshi Dasgupta agrees.
It's 3pm and speakers are becoming more ferocious in their attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP party.
Among the speakers is Prof Ajith Kanna.
""If Kanhaiya is anti-national, then I am also anti-national,"" he tells the cheering crowd.

171,"One is the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas; the other is Singapore.
Each one has that certain je ne sais quoi that lifts them out of the humdrum and makes them exceptional.
As far as Singapore goes, it's no surprise it has become second only to Monaco as the place where most business gets done over a grand prix weekend. It's a place you just really want to go.
That message permeates, and has made it into one of the most desirable races on the calendar.
For a start, the ambience is terrific - and, let's be honest, this is what appeals to the business visitors, rather than the demands of racing on one of the longest tracks in F1 in crippling humidity.
Singapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. But hosting the race at night adds an extra dimension.
The track jags through the city centre under lights, Chinese lanterns adding a dash of colour, the futuristic city skyline the backdrop.
As the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while. Darkness takes the edge off the tropical heat, and a heady, luscious tropical atmosphere settles over the place.
For those working at the race, there's a surreal edge to it, too.
Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them.
First track sessions at dusk, qualifying and race after dark means staying on European time. So you wake up at 2pm, finish work in the early hours and go to bed at six in the morning.
You can eat in a hotel restaurant, some of which stay open all night for the race weekend. Better, though, to head to an all-night hawkers' market, where delicious, cheap local food is on offer from a myriad of stalls and you can drink in the atmosphere of the place.
Oh, and the track is pretty good, too. It's no Spa or Suzuka, but the Marina Bay Circuit has a challenge all of its own.
A long, long lap, a nearly two-hour race, bumps, 23 corners and intense humidity make it arguably the toughest grand prix on the calendar - only Malaysia comes close.
Add it all up and it's a race not to be missed.

172,"Neill Birnie is paralysed from the neck down as a result of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.
In 2014, he was admitted to Antrim Area Hospital three times.
He said that following the first admission he discovered a DNR order had been placed on his medical file.
According to Mr Birnie, the order had been placed on his record without his knowledge.
The 48-year-old is unable to talk and spoke to me via a head-operated computer.
""A consultant told me that I had gone through enough and I had to face the facts.
""He went on to say that he'd consulted with others and that they both thought that a DNR notice should be placed on my admission file,"" said Mr Birnie.
He told the BBC that at no time did either he or his sister grant permission for a DNR notice to be placed on his file. While he survived the first bout of pneumonia, he said he discovered when admitted for a second time that the DNR notice had not been removed.
""What some of the doctors did was life-threatening and mentally cruel. I felt I had been tossed to the one side, I had no feelings of self worth,"" added Mr Birnie.
Several months after the incident, Mr Birnie made an official complaint to the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.
In a letter to Mr Birnie dated October 2015 and seen by the BBC, the trust explained that as he was so unwell they had spoken to his sister.
The trust also said that if the infection had caused his heart to stop, medical staff would not have been able to bring him back and that attempts at cardio respiratory resuscitation would not have been in his best interests.
However, Mr Birnie said he does not accept that a DNR notice was placed on his file in advance of him being admitted without his or his sister's consent.
In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust confirmed that a DNR notice was placed on Mr Birnie's file in January 2014, but not before a conversation had taken place with their patient.
""The decision to implement a DNR is a medical one, which is taken in cases where medical professionals feel that if a person's medical condition at that time causes their heart to stop, resuscitation attempts would be futile and therefore not in their best interests in providing a dignified death.
""This was discussed with Mr Birnie initially and was put in place following a conversation with his next of kin who indicated that they had talked it over with Mr Birnie and agreed with the decision taken,"" the statement said.
""A DNR notice is reviewed and, if felt appropriate, renewed on a daily basis. There is currently no DNR on Mr Birnie's file and his treatment remains unaffected.""
A DNR notice is an extremely sensitive issue. Often the subject can arise when a person least expects it or is not in a position to make a rational judgement.
The order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops.
The decision to use one is ultimately a doctor's, but official guidelines from the British Medical Association (BMA) state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible.
The problem for medical staff is that sometimes the conversation between doctor and the patient or family may not take place in time.
The usual circumstances in which it is appropriate not to resuscitate are when it will not restart the heart or breathing; when there is no benefit to the patient; and when the benefits are outweighed by the burdens.
The guidelines also say that it should only be issued after discussions with the patient or family.
However, according to Neill Birnie that did not happen.
As a quadriplegic who requires 24-hour care via the computer, he told me he is still a human being with feelings: ""The lights are still on and I am definitely at home.""

The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on.
In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP.
The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place.
Ms Hilton said: ""After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before.""
Labour majority: 2,873
Turnout 24,200 - 42.65%
Swing: 6.94% from SNP to Labour
And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: ""We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one  that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016.
""Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession.""
The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge.
Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought.
""We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open,"" she said.
The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night.
Candidate Susan Leslie said: ""I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline.""
Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: ""When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives.""
Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%.","Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes."

178,"The force's interest in using the birds of prey follows trials in the Netherlands.
Drones - pilot-less aircraft which are controlled remotely - are used by police forces to capture footage on difficult terrain, including cliffs.
But there are concerns criminals are also using the new technology.
In November, the Ministry of Justice said a drone used to smuggle mobile phones, SIM cards and drugs into the grounds of HMP Manchester had been recovered by guards.
The MoJ reported nine attempts to use drones to infiltrate prisons in England and Wales in the first five months of 2015.
A think tank has also warned that drones could be used by terrorist groups.
The UK Air Proximity Board said last month that drones had been involved in four serious near misses at UK airports.
The birds would help by taking down the aircraft, which they would consider to be prey.
However, Jemima Parry-Jones, who is the director of the International Centre of Birds of Prey in Gloucestershire, described the idea as a ""gimmick"".
""Eagles are big, powerful birds; they should not be flown in built-up areas. And secondly in terms of the safety of the bird, you're asking it to grab hold of a drone, which often have four rotating blades keeping it in the air,"" she said.
""If the police in the UK are asking the right experts they should listen to our advice.
""If you don't believe us, try putting your own fingers into the propeller of a reasonably sized drone and see what happens.""
But a spokesman for the RSPCA said: ""In principle we would not have an issue with police forces training eagles in an attempt to tackle drones, although we would have concerns over the welfare of the birds.
""At the moment, however, there is not enough information available for us to be able to make an informed comment.""
A Met Police spokesman said: ""As would be expected in an organisation that is transforming, we take an interest in all innovative new ideas and will of course be looking at the work of the Dutch police use of eagles.""",The Metropolitan Police says it is considering using eagles to intercept drones amid concerns the aircraft are increasingly used to commit crime.
179,"The oyster beds were laid off the coast of Porlock Bay in 2013 as part of an initiative to boost employment and ""improve the image of the area"".
Now, the farming of the shellfish has taken off, secured the highest quality rating and are due to be sold locally.
Roger Hall, from the Porlock Futures Community Interest Company, said it had been a ""brilliantly successful trial"".
Using oysters from Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, trials were set up to establish whether the shellfish could be farmed in the seas around Porlock.
""We've proved the oysters not only grow but have got the best Class A classification for cleanliness you can get,"" said Mr Hall.
""It's the realisation of what started off as an interesting idea and now we've got 70 trestles with thousands of oysters on them all waiting to be eaten in the restaurants.""
Following a successful trial, the project has been awarded Â£75,000 from the Power To Change fund and raised more than Â£65,000 from the local community.
David Salter, from the Community Interest Company, said they ""haven't got the fastest growing site in the South West"" but are hoping to sell around 30,000 oysters this year.
""Next year, we'll be getting up to the 80,000 and then in four to five years we'll have 500,000,"" he said.

180,"Capped 94 times, Phillips' comments come as criticism has been levelled at coach Rob Howley for failing to bring new players into the Wales team.
As they prepare to face France, Wales have capped just three new players since the 2015 World Cup, but Phillips says he understands the situation.
""You can't just blood youngsters because they are young,"" he said.
Since 2015, only Blues flanker Ellis Jenkins, Newport Gwent Dragons lock Cory Hill and Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies have been handed their senior debuts.
In Wales' final Six Nations clash in Paris, there have been calls for Howley to have one eye on the future and play new faces.
Instead the has stuck with the same side that beat Ireland last time out.
This comes despite Howley having a host of uncapped players in his squad in the shape of Ospreys flanker Olly Cracknell and lock Rory Thornton, Leicester fly-half Owen Williams, Scarlets wing Steffan Evans, Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt, Scarlets scrum-half Aled Davies and Wasps flanker Thomas Young.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Howley has also ignored calls for Davies to start at fly-half and for Ospreys' teenager Keelan Giles to come in on the wing.
Phillips said he agreed with Howley's decision and that he believed the onus was on the young players to show they are ready for the senior side.
""There's a few guys on the verge, but those youngsters have still got to learn,"" Phillips told BBC Radio Wales.
""They are young and developing, but they will get their time in seasons to come. But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players.""
Against France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on.
He added: ""It's a difficult one. In that international jersey should be the best because you are the best in the position. You should not just hand out caps willy-nilly to people.
""The development of the future is an important thing, but that needs to be done in a structured way.
""But it has been difficult because of the way things have panned out. They've looked to get the wins and back those players. The best players in Wales are playing on the field, it's as simple as that really.""",Former scrum-half Mike Phillips has urged Wales' rising stars to prove they are good enough for the national side.
181,"The Dudley Business Loan Fund is aimed at businesses in the borough with fewer than 250 staff that have struggled to secure bank loans.
The scheme is a partnership between Dudley Council and the Black Country Reinvestment Society (BCRS).
Councillor Shaukat Ali said he believed it could play a ""vital role"" in stimulating the local economy.
He said there were some 9,000 businesses in the area that could be eligible.
The scheme, offering loans of £10,000 to £50,000, is open to small and medium-sized businesses with a turnover of less than £5m.
The scheme has been joint funded by the council and BCRS through a European grant.
Paul Kalinaucas, chief executive of the BCRS not-for-profit lender, said the fund would help Dudley ""develop, grow and prosper"".
Cradley Heath manufacturer Sealco benefited from a £50,000 BCRS loan in 2008 and said small sums could sometimes make a big difference.
Managing Director Rob Fowkes said: ""In that year it helped us maintain staffing levels and got us through the very sticky parts that were 2008 and 2009.""
Since 2009, the company has doubled its workforce and doubled its turnover to more than £2m.

182,"Transgender protesters forced a halt to debate on the bill on Wednesday.
Last month, the state approved a human rights measure banning gender identity discrimination at public facilities.
In recent weeks, two other states passed laws ensuring equal access to gender-segregated facilities for transgender students.
The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate.
Penalties could include six months in prison.
""If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,"" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for the advocacy group Lambda Legal.
But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender.
""This law simply restores the law of society: men are men and women are women,"" Mr Kavanagh said, according to the Associated Press.
""For a handful of people to make everyone else uncomfortable just makes no sense.""
But, Mr Kavanagh added, police would be allowed to use their discretion over whether to press charges if women used the men's room to avoid a long queue.
On Wednesday, Mr Kavanagh agreed to postpone a vote on the bill at the start of a hearing filled with dozens of transgender activists.
The bill's opponents say it would force transgender people to reveal themselves and risk harassment,
""Most transgender people try to slip through public places without being noticed,'' activist Erica Keppler said.
""This will turn us into criminals.""
And advocates say transgender people can find it difficult to change gender on their birth certificates because many states require proof of gender treatment surgery.
Meanwhile, other states such as Idaho and Ohio do not allow such changes at all, the American Civil Liberties Union said.
It is already illegal to discriminate against transgender people in 16 US states, although the extent of protections can vary, the group added.

The BBC said he was attacked by a gang of youths while reportedly walking to a nightclub with colleagues on Saturday.
A Strictly spokesman said Mr Marquez ""doesn't wish to make a formal complaint"" and ""just wants to move on"".
The 26-year-old Spaniard was in the Lancashire resort for a live edition of the show from Blackpool Tower Ballroom when he was the victim of an ""unprovoked incident"".
Mr Marquez was getting out of a car when a ""random group of lads"" ran past and assaulted him, the Strictly spokesman added.
A Lancashire Police spokesperson said: ""We have checked CCTV and spoken to the club and inquiries continue.
""We have had no formal complaint from Mr Marquez.""
After the attack, Marquez tweeted: ""Thanks for all your kind messages and support about Blackpool.
""It was a bad experience but I'm feeling better and just want to look forward to the show on Saturday!""

The scenario had not been discussed with parents or senior staff first, the school admitted.

In a statement, the school said: ""We intended to provide a scenario that would enable the children to empathise with those we were raising money for.
""In future all activities of this nature will be discussed with a member of the senior leadership team prior to being undertaken.
""Only options that allow the children to empathise and understand without causing them unnecessary stress and anxiety will be considered and approved.""

An online appeal set up by beautician Katie Cutler raised £330,135.
Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, had pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob at Newcastle Crown Court.
After the sentencing, Mr Barnes said it was ""just about the right length of time"" and he hoped prison would give Gatiss time to reflect on what he had done.
""I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful,"" he said.
Gatiss, from Split Crow Road, was caught after police retrieved DNA evidence from a pocket on Mr Barnes' jacket.
He had been desperate for money to buy legal highs but ran off empty-handed when Mr Barnes shouted for help, the court heard.
Judge Paul Sloan QC described Gatiss' actions as ""despicable and opportunistic"" and said he had picked on Mr Barnes because he was vulnerable.
Mr Barnes has lived with disabilities from birth after his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant. He is visually impaired and stands 4ft 6in (1.21m) tall.
After the hearing, Mr Barnes, who was joined by 21-year-old Miss Cutler, said: ""I'm pleased he's been sentenced and I think the sentence of four years is just about the right length.
""I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful. Maybe he might decide to help people, which I think would be a good idea for him.
""It's sad that he was brought to the stage of doing something like this - not necessarily just me, it could have been anybody and they might not have got over the incident.
""But I've moved on,"" he said.
Holding back tears, Miss Cutler added: ""It's hard for me to talk about Richard as it wasn't me who was attacked, but I just hope he gets the help that he deserves.
""I'm just glad that that some good has come from this and we can move forward.""
While on remand, Gatiss was kept in segregation for his own safety.
Jamie Adams, defending, said it was ""an awful case"" but publicity surrounding it made it difficult to ""keep a proper outlook on what the sentence should be"".
On the prison bus to court Gatiss had been ""the subject of some pretty awful double-standard behaviour"" from other inmates, Mr Adams said.
""Life is not easy for him. He is going to be in the public glare for a long time to come and he knows that.""

188,"A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications.
This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.
The Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training.
Study leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes.
This shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added.
In the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children.
During a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications.
Only half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines.
And only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children.
There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels.
The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood.
Doctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished.
Dr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training.
""In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country.""
But he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications.
""From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,"" he added.
Prof Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues.
""We are refreshing training on adolescent health,"" he said.
""And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.""","Doctors may be failing to spot tell-tale signs in children who are underweight, a study suggests."
189,"Couples will now be allowed to have two children, it said, citing a statement from the Communist Party.
The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate.
It is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births. However concerns at China's ageing population led to pressure for change.
Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions.
Over time, the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, as demographers and sociologists raised concerns about rising social costs and falling worker numbers.
The decision to allow families to have two children was designed ""to improve the balanced development of population'' and to deal with an aging population, according to the statement from the Community Party's Central Committee carried by the official Xinhua News Agency (in Chinese) on Thursday.
Currently about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50. The total population of the country is around 1.36 billion.
The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child.

What was China's one-child policy?
Trauma and sympathy shared online
Correspondents say that despite the relaxation of the rules, many couples may opt to only have one child, as one-child families have become the social norm.
Critics say that even a two-child policy will not boost the birth rate enough, the BBC's John Sudworth reports.
And for those women who want more than two children, nor will it end the state's insistence on the right to control their fertility, he adds.
""As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remains, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,"" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told AFP.
I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. And even then, I wasn't supposed to be born.
In my parents' work unit, there were also quotas for babies. By the time my mother announced her pregnancy, the quotas were all used up for the year.
But kind-hearted officials decided to look the other way and allowed my birth. My would-be siblings were less lucky.
As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. Even today, she talks about 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' and what they might have been like.

The Eiffel Tower in Paris is expected to be lit up in green light on Friday to mark the entry into force of the historic climate pact.
Delegates from almost 200 countries are meeting in Marrakech next week to consider the way ahead beyond Paris.
The deal agreed in the French capital less than a year ago commits governments to moving their economies away from fossil fuels.
On Thursday, a UN review of national pledges to cut carbon said they fall short of the levels needed to keep the rise in global temperatures under 2C.
The report found pledges from governments that have ratified the accord would see the world on track for a rise in temperatures by the end of this century of between 2.9 and 3.4 degrees C.
Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst
The Paris climate pact comes into force less than a year since it was agreed. The last major climate deal - the Kyoto Protocol - took eight years to come into force. Paris is the first agreement tying rich and poor nations in a common endeavour to protect the climate. However, the national targets for cutting carbon emissions are voluntary. The UN tried a mandatory approach but countries that were failing to meet their targets simply quit.
The process of the Paris deal is binding, including a commitment for governments to keep returning to the issue to ratchet up the clean energy targets that they all agree are inadequate. Governments that rushed to enshrine Paris in law have had one eye on the US elections. Hilary Clinton has pledged to take President Obama's emissions cuts further. Donald Trump wants to tear up the agreement.
Environmental groups and other experts have urged governments to do more.
World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim said even with the commitments made in Paris and encouraging action on the ground, ""we will not meet our aspiration of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees unless we move faster and at the scale that is needed"".
""As the world heads into (the meeting) in Marrakesh, we must regain the sense of urgency we felt a year ago,"" he said.
In Marrakech governments and parties will work on details of a ""rulebook"" which will measure and review global climate action.
What was agreed in Paris?
•         To peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and achieve a balance between sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century
•         To keep global temperature increase ""well below"" 2C (3.6F) and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C
•         To review progress every five years
•         $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, with a commitment to further finance in the future.
Donald Trump has called manmade climate change ""a hoax"" and said he would ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement and other international efforts to address the issue. He says he supports clean water and air, but wants to slash funding to the Environmental Protection Agency in the US.
Hillary Clinton backs the Paris deal, saying climate change is a threat to American security. She supports stringent regulation of the energy industry and opposes expanded drilling in Alaska, but has not made the environment a central part of her campaign.

The aim was mainly to highlight women's rights, which activists believe to be under threat from the new administration.
Mr Trump did not mention the protests during a bridge-building visit to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday but instead turned on the press.
He accused the media of inventing a feud between him and the intelligence community and he called reporters ""among the most dishonest human beings on earth"".
Mr Trump said TV footage and photos of his inauguration had painted an inaccurate picture.
""It looked like a million and a half people"" there on Friday, he said, rubbishing media reports that there were as few as 250,000 people.
He also said the crowd extended all the way back to the Washington Monument, although this claim is contradicted by aerial shots from the day.
Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer berated reporters at a news conference over photographs that had shown large, empty spaces during the ceremony.
""This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe,"" he said in a fiery statement.
""These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm about the inauguration are shameful and wrong.""
In addition to the photographic evidence, Washington's Metro system said trips were down on previous inaugurations. Marketing firm Nielsen said television views in the US were less than Barack Obama's and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations.
Mr Spicer, who did not take questions, added: ""There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable, and I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable as well.""
Outgoing CIA chief John Brennan accused Mr Trump of ""a despicable display of self-aggrandisement"" over the statement at Langley.
""Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandisement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of agency heroes,"" his former deputy, Nick Shapiro, said in a statement carried by CNN.
""Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself.""
Last week, Mr Brennan called on Mr Trump to be more ""disciplined"" in what he said and warned him not to underestimate Russian intentions.
Mr Trump's visit had sought to mend relations with the intelligence community after weeks of doubting their conclusions about alleged Russian interference into the US election.
""I love you, I respect you,"" he said, adding that he was ""1,000%"" behind the spy agency.
Mr Trump said the media had invented a feud between them, although in a recent row over a leaked dossier that alleged the Kremlin held compromising material on him, he had likened the actions of intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany.
Mr Trump's election has divided opinion in the US and around the world.
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, writing in Bild newspaper on Sunday, warned that the world was headed ""for turbulent times.""
""With the election of Donald Trump, the world of the 20th century has definitely been overtaken,"" he said.",President Donald Trump has accused the media of dishonestly reporting the size of the crowd at his inauguration.
195,"This is how many Ukrainians start and finish their summer holiday in Russian-annexed Crimea.
Queues of cars snake for several hours as people wait to visit relatives or get to the peninsula for a beach break.
Lorry-loads of watermelons are sold by the side of the road while people wait to be checked or waved through, in the southern region of Kherson, next to Crimea, where Kiev's vast Dnipro river enters the Black Sea.
Aside from the odd soldier dug in by the side of the road and the vigilance of Ukraine's border guards, there is little to suggest that the country is preparing for Russian military action from the south.
Most analysts think any such action would be highly unlikely.
But after Russia seized Crimea in March 2014 without firing a shot, Ukraine has learnt to expect the unexpected from its powerful neighbour.
Vigilance is the watchword of Ukraine's National Border Guard.
Spokesman Ivan Shevcov said his colleagues were ""prepared for any type of action from the Russian side"".
The war of words between Russia and Ukraine has intensified following Moscow's accusation that Kiev plotted a sabotage attack in Crimea.
Russian President Vladimir Putin promised a response.
Russia has moved more military hardware on to the peninsula. And pictures of the Russian navy carrying out military drills in Crimea to counter the threat of saboteurs were quickly beamed around the world.
This week Russia is carrying out more exercises in Crimea to counter the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has put his military on high alert. He insists the Russian claim of a sabotage attack by Ukrainian special forces was cooked up by the Kremlin to justify future attacks.
However little, if anything, has changed at the checkpoints in and out of Crimea.
One man from the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa said he went there only to visit his elderly mother who lived there and wouldn't leave.
When she dies, he will not travel there any more.
For Igor, travelling to Crimea to visit relatives, the latest rhetoric is ""mostly exaggerated"".
""Whatever you see on TV, (with) saboteur groups arrested, I think this can be faked by any side. Each side can create provocations.""
With his tennis racket bag slung over his shoulder, Artyom, a Ukrainian probably in his 20s, explains how pleasant his holiday in Crimea has been, and how friendly the people there were. And he is not alone.
""The Russians say one thing and the Ukrainians another. I don't know who to trust,"" says an elderly woman with sunglasses.
The line between fact and fiction is often blurred when it comes to Russia's tactics and actions in relation to Ukraine.
Kiev calls this ""hybrid warfare"", which mixes propaganda with cyber attacks and semi-clandestine operations.
Tamara is driving across to Crimea, where she owns property, with her chihuahua Charlie.
She might not believe all the rumours in Kiev. However, she does not trust the Russian version of recent events.
""I think [the Russians] did this intentionally. But I don't know why they did this during the holiday season. Everything was fine when I came here in June with my mum.""
Tamara's mother-in-law and daughter were going to join her on the trip to Crimea, but because of what they had seen on the news they decided to stay in Kiev.
Across the water from Crimea in the small town of Skadovsk, the melee of swimsuits and food-sellers on the beach is proof that many Ukrainians will simply not travel to Russian-annexed Crimea as a point of principle.
Few seem to notice the Ukrainian National Border Guard soldiers high above in their concrete look-out post at the back of the beach, behind an invisible network of trenches.
For all the political rhetoric of recent days, the fun-loving normality of the summer season in southern Ukraine goes on.","Barbed wire, armed soldiers and several hefty concrete checkpoints."
196,"British Gas unveiled a 5.1% price reduction, followed swiftly by EDF's announcement of a 5% cut.
British Gas's price change takes effect on 16 March, while EDF's kicks in eight days later.
The moves benefit customers on a standard domestic gas tariff.
Britain's big six energy suppliers have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since this time last year.
E.On was the first to announce a cut this year of 5.1%, followed by similar reductions by SSE, Scottish Power and Npower.
Executive director at consumer group Which?, Richard Lloyd, said :""Seeing all of the big suppliers mirror each other with small cuts in the face of falling wholesale prices will raise questions in many people's minds about whether competition is working in this market.""
British Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said 6.8 million of its customers on dual-fuel deals would see an average annual saving of Â£31 due to the 5.1% cut.
It said customers on so-called ""fix and fall"" tariffs would also benefit from the price reduction.
EDF said about 900,000 of its customers would also make an annual saving of Â£31.
It said it had no exit fees on any of its fixed deals.
Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: ""Our prices are under constant review and today's announcement reflects falls in wholesale gas costs.""
Centrica's Mark Hodges, chief executive of its energy supply and services in UK and Ireland, said: ""Competitive pricing is the way to retain existing customers and win new business in this hard-fought market.""
Some commentators warn that these types of ""standard"" tariffs are among the most expensive, so there is still benefit in shopping around.
Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, said: ""These price cuts are a movement in the right direction for loyal customers, but they are dwarfed by the savings available by switching from a standard tariff to a fixed deal.
""You could save more money, up to Â£300, by switching.""
There was also criticism of the industry for failing to cut electricity tariffs, despite falling wholesale costs.
Energy analysts at Jefferies said: ""There has still been no movement in electricity tariffs, despite a 30% fall in wholesale electricity prices since August 2014.
""This is likely due to increased environmental costs, which fall on electricity rather than gas, and additional network charges.""
British Gas said it was unable to lower electricity prices due to rising costs, such as for network delivery, adding that wholesale costs only make up a third of electricity bills.
Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd said there was still more to do.
Suppliers are awaiting the outcome of a competition watchdog investigation set to conclude in June, which Ms Rudd said would help determine if consumers were getting a ""rough deal"".","British Gas and EDF Energy have announced they are cutting their gas prices, the last of the big six energy suppliers to do so."

200,"In a Commons debate, the ex-Labour leader said Conservative plans to limit the voting powers of Scottish MPs on Commons laws would ""rip up"" hundreds of years of parliamentary procedure.
The SNP said the Conservatives wanted to create a ""quasi-English Parliament"".
But ministers said it was vital England was treated fairly as further powers were devolved to other parts of the UK.
At the end of the debate, Labour staged and won a vote in which the government abstained. And Conservative MP David Davis raised a point of order to urge the government to allow more time for the matter to be considered.
The government believes bills applying exclusively to England should not become law without the explicit consent of MPs from English constituencies and it wants to change Commons rules known as standing orders to give them a ""decisive say"" during their passage.
Ministers say this will address the longstanding anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting England but English MPs have no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved.
Mark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondent
Panic stations? From the point of view of the government whips this afternoon's emergency Commons debate on English Votes for English Laws was really rather alarming.
The debate, so skilfully secured by Lib Dem ex Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael, produced a slightly pointless vote in which the Conservatives mostly abstained, but it brought all kinds of nasty tensions to the surface.
Conservative MPs are supposed to be signed up for EVEL under the terms of their manifesto, but there were clearly quite a few with doubts, some about the policy, many more about the process, which was Mr Carmichael's line of attack.

However, the plans came under sustained attack from Labour, SNP and Lib Dems in an urgent debate, secured by former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael.
MPs are due to debate and vote on the government's plans next week but Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the plans required more detailed consideration, arguably through primary legislation.
If MPs representing constituencies in England had a ""veto"" on certain legislation, it would breach the longstanding principle that MPs, no matter who they represented, were ""all equal"".
""To go as far as the government wants to go in the timescale they want to go brings with it an attendant level of risk that I would consider to be irresponsible,"" he said.
""They are not entitled to use the UK Parliament as a proxy for an English Parliament.""
Assurances that the new system would be reviewed by MPs after a year were inadequate, he added, saying this would not be capable of ""putting a dangerous genie back in the bottle after it had been let out - we all know that is the political reality"".
But Commons Leader Chris Grayling said it was ""simply incorrect"" to claim some MPs would be prevented from debating and voting on certain legislation and would continue to exercise the same rights as they do now.
Pressed by Mr Miliband on ""what the meaning and definition"" of English-only legislation would be, Mr Grayling said it would be up to the Speaker to decide but he believed a ""simple test"" would be what things were devolved to Scotland.
Requiring bills to have the support of a ""double majority"" of the whole of the Commons and those MPs representing England would also help mitigate ""any resentment"" felt by English voters about the slower pace of devolution to England.
""It is of vital importance that English citizens of the UK, as we move to an extra layer of devolution to Scotland and Wales and devolve additional tax powers to Northern Ireland, that they think it is fair,"" he said.
""It is what we pledged to do in our manifesto. We set it out in detail, step by step by step. We are implementing these changes and keeping our promises. I think the people who elected us would expect nothing else.""
Mr Miliband said the Conservatives had the power to address the issue after winning the election but urged them to think again.
""Is this true to the traditions of Conservatism? No because the last thing you do is rip up hundreds of years of constitutional practice in a standing order vote just before the House goes into recess,"" he said.
""Doing this procedure in the way it is being proposed is an act of constitutional vandalism. It really is.""
The SNP said Scottish voters would be affected by legislation on schools and NHS budgets in England through the Barnett Formula used to allocate public spending to different nations of the UK.
""This not just English votes for English laws, this is English votes for Scottish laws,"" said Pete Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire. ""It is totally and utterly unacceptable.""
He added: ""Why don't they just tattoo our foreheads 'Scottish' and then they would be able to identify us.""
And Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh said the move would not make any difference to the outcome of votes and urged ministers to omit laws which indirectly applied to Scotland, saying not to do so would be a ""gift"" to the SNP's independence campaign.
Responding to a question by an SNP MP on Monday, Mr Grayling said the only English-only measure during the last Parliament had been the Education Bill, and there were 13 Bills which applied to England and Wales.","Plans for ""English votes for English laws"" are an ""act of constitutional vandalism"", Ed Miliband has warned."

202,"The animal has been studied for some time, but new research confirms it is different from all other gibbons.
It has been named the Skywalker hoolock gibbon - partly because the Chinese characters of its scientific name mean ""Heaven's movement"" but also because the scientists are fans of Star Wars.
The study is published in the American Journal of Primatology.
Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, who was part of the team studying the apes, told BBC News: ""In this area, so many species have declined or gone extinct because of habitat loss, hunting and general human overpopulation.
""So it's an absolute privilege to see something as special and as rare as a gibbon in a canopy in a Chinese rainforest, and especially when it turns out that the gibbons are actually a new species previously unrecognised by science.""
Hoolock gibbons are found in Bangladesh, India, China and Myanmar. They spend most of their time living in the treetops, swinging through the forests with their forelimbs, rarely spending any time on the ground.
But the research team - led by Fan Peng-Fei from Sun Yat-sen University in China - started to suspect that the animals they were studying in China's Yunnan Province were unusual.
All hoolock gibbons have white eyebrows and some have white beards - but the Chinese primates' markings differed in appearance.
Their songs, which they use to bond with other gibbons and to mark out their territory, also had an unusual ring.
So the team carried out a full physical and genetic comparison with other gibbons, which confirmed that the primates were indeed a different species.
They have been given the scientific name of Hoolock tianxing - but their common name is now the Skywalker hoolock gibbon, thanks to the scientists' taste in films.
Dr Turvey said the team had been studying the animals in the Gaoligongshan nature reserve, but it was not easy.
""It's difficult to get into the reserve. You have to hike up to above 2,500m to find the gibbons. That's where the good quality forest usually starts - everywhere below there has been logged.
""Then you have to wake up really early in the morning and you listen out for the haunting song of the gibbons, which carries in the forest canopy.
""And when you hear it, you rush through the mud and the mist, and run for hundreds of metres to try and catch up with these gibbons.""
The researchers estimate that there are about 200 of the Skywalker gibbons living in China - and also some living in neighbouring Myanmar, although the population size there is currently unknown.
The team warns that the primates are at risk of extinction.
""The low number of surviving animals and the threat they face from habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and hunting means we think they should be classified as an endangered species,"" said Dr Turvey.
In response to the news, actor Mark Hamill - the original Luke Skywalker - said on Twitter that he was so proud to have a new jungle Jedi named after his character.

205,"The New South Wales premier's page was flooded with comments, almost all negative, after he mounted a defence of controversial ""lockout laws"" that many say have killed off Sydney's night-time economy.
Mr Baird says the laws are reducing assaults, and that a number of small bars have opened since the laws were introduced.
But questions have also been raised about why the city's Star Casino and another planned casino are exempt - the Star falls just outside the zone - leading to the premier being mocked with the hashtag #casinomike.
Since February 2014, bars and clubs within parts of Sydney have been required to shut their doors to new patrons from 1.30 in the morning and stop serving drinks at 3:00, with severe penalties for bar owners who breach the conditions.
Sales of takeaway alcohol from hotels and shops are banned statewide after 22:00.
The origin of these laws can be traced to July 2012, when 19-year-old Kieran Loveridge walked up to Thomas Kelly in the entertainment precinct of Kings Cross and, without provocation or warning, punched him in the head.
Mr Kelly, 19, fell to the ground and later died in hospital.
Kings Cross saw its second ""coward punch"" death on New Year's Eve in 2013, when bodybuilder Shaun McNeil, 27, killed 18-year-old Daniel Christie with a single blow in an unprovoked attack.
Both attackers were jailed.
Public outcry over these incidents was immense, and the NSW government responded by designating Sydney's most popular party zones a ""CBD Entertainment Precinct"".
But it had a devastating impact on businesses that depended on late-night trade, particularly around the Kings Cross area.
Some of Australia's best-known bars and clubs shut down, among them Hugos Lounge, which had operated for 15 years and was voted best nightclub in Australia six times.
Owner Dave Evans said the laws caused a 60% drop in trade, forcing him to close his doors and put 170 staff out of work.
Frustration over the laws' impact on Sydney's nightlife crystalysed last week with the publication on LinkedIn of an 8,000-word essay by businessman Matt Barrie.
Mr Barrie passionately denounced the impact of the laws and pushed a philosophy of personal responsibility that touched a nerve with many Sydneysiders.
""You've been tricked into thinking that you have done something wrong, in some way that you are genetically an idiot, or that somehow you have to feel responsible for a couple of random tragic, yet unrelated, events that occurred in the vague proximity of having fun,"" he wrote.
""Two young men that would be turning in their graves if they knew that their deaths had been hijacked to beat up some moral outrage over the sort of human tragedy that sells newspapers to put up a political smokescreen, push a prohibitionist evangelical agenda, sell a suburb to developers, and boost the coffers of a couple of casinos.""
Reaction to Mr Barrie's piece prompted Mr Baird, a conservative and Christian, to respond on social media, where he had previous success live-tweeting amusing responses to the finale of reality television show The Bachelor.
""Alcohol-related assaults have decreased 42.2% in the CBD since we introduced the 'lockout laws'. And they are down by over 60% in Kings Cross,"" he wrote.
""But didn't we achieve this by shutting down the whole city and killing its nightlife? The number of small bars in Sydney has more than doubled in the same period.""
""Doctors right across the city are now telling us they are seeing far less emergency room presentations on the weekends.""
But this time the move appears to have backfired, with the post attracting more than 12,000 comments, overwhelmingly negative.
""I am not proud of our city and embarrassed to invite guests here from overseas,"" said one.
Another said the state was ""treating us all like kids because of the actions of random street scum"".
""Sydney has a rich history of the inner city pub which you are destroying,"" said another. ""Thanks mate #casinomike.""
Popular Australian DJ and musician Alison Wonderland was one of the many who responded to Mr Baird.
""Words can't explain how embarrassed I am that my home, the most beautiful and once most vibrant city in the world has become a laughing stock internationally,"" she wrote.
""People are asking me if it's true Sydney has become a nanny state and voice their genuine concerns about visiting it.""
Another commenter was Justin Maloney, owner of the restaurant Jimmy Liks, which closed last month after 14 years.
""You said you wanted to 'eliminate drinking ghettos' - well, Mr Baird, my award-winning restaurant was no ghetto but you certainly eliminated it,"" he wrote.
Even Mr Baird's ""cherry picked"" assault statistics were called into question.
The lockout laws are almost two years old now and due to be subjected to a detailed review.
But Mr Baird indicated he was unlikely to change the policy, which he believed was ""so clearly improving the city"".
But it remains to be seen if the popular premier will hold his ground if anger at the lockout laws continues to gather momentum.","It took a single Facebook post to turn Mike Baird, leader of Australia's most populous state, from darling to pariah on social media."

Asked whether he would stand for the leadership again if Mr Corbyn wins, he said: ""I am not ruling anything in or anything out,"" adding that this was ""a hypothetical question for the dim and distant future"".
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn's campaign said: ""You can tell things are going from bad to worse for Owen Smith's desperate campaign as he turns his vitriol on Labour members instead of the Tory government.
""The inconvenient truth for Owen Smith is that Labour polled ahead of the Tories in May's local elections; and we have won all parliamentary by-elections under Jeremy's leadership, as well as having won mayoral elections in Bristol, London, Liverpool and Salford.
""Rather than repeatedly talking down our party, and refusing to accept the outcome of this contest, Owen Smith should reflect on his use of such a divisive approach for the rest of this contest.""","Labour leadership hopeful Owen Smith has accused Jeremy Corbyn of being ""delusional"" about the party's prospects of power under his tenure."
211,"Tomasz Procko, 22, and Karol Szymanski, 29, had been delivering sofas to the Knightsbridge property on Friday morning when the balcony collapsed.
Mr Procko, of Greenford, west London, died at the scene while Mr Szymanski, of Wembley, north-west London, died later in hospital.
Both men were originally from Poland. Their next of kin had been informed.
Eight other people were treated for injuries, the London Ambulance Service said.
A neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, told BBC News: ""They were trying to pull a couch up to the first-floor apartment with ropes.
""[It] was apparently too heavy. The fence broke off and fell on the workmen below.""
Sinclair Johnston, an engineer who has worked on another property in the square, said the decorative railings could not be depended upon to support weight.
The decorative wrought-iron railing appeared to have fallen about 3.6m (12ft) to the ground, although the stone base of the balcony appeared undamaged.",Two men who died after they fell from a balcony at Cadogan Square in west London have been named by police.
212,"The US central bank said it had unanimously agreed to keep rates at close to zero this month, but believed the economy was on a stronger footing.
""Economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months,"" it said in a statement.
But it still did not give a clear indication of when rates would rise.
In its statement, the Fed noted that the job market, housing and consumer spending had all improved.
The central bank's policy makers also said they expected inflation to rise gradually toward its 2% target.
On employment - which is now at a seven-year low of 5.3% - the bank said job gains had been ""solid"", more  positive language than last month.
But it again reiterated that it would only hike its benchmark interest rate ""when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective"".
The Fed's decision to keep its main interest rate on hold this month had been widely expected.
""The bottom line is they didn't do a lot.
""But they've nudged the market in the direction of a 2015 rate hike. And it's increased our confidence in a September rate hike,"" Millan Mulraine, deputy head of US strategy at TD Securities told the BBC.
Barclays economist Michael Gapen said that he also still expected a rate rise in September, which he said remained the bank's ""baseline forecast""
And Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds, said the statement confirmed the Fed was ""taking baby steps"" towards an increase.
The interest rate has now been at a record low for six and a half years.
The US central bank's decision to cut the rate to such a low level in December 2008 was aimed at boosting growth in the economy amid the global financial crisis.
Most analysts expect the first hike in September, but Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has emphasised that any increase will be determined by the latest economic data.
She has also said that when rates do begin to rise, the increase will only be gradual.
US stock markets, which were up ahead of the Fed's decision, continued to trade higher after the decision.","The US Federal Reserve has indicated it is more positive on the US economy, confirming views it is likely to raise interest rates this year."

215,"Regardless of the horse race that sprung from Lord Derby calling it right and winning that toss at Epsom in 1779, defeat would have had a much wider significance.
The event and its name are believed to be the root of the expression 'derby match', and it's worth considering that the loser was Sir Charles Bunbury.
You'll agree the 'Merseyside Bunbury' or the 'North London Bunbury' hardly have the same ring.
More than two centuries on from that coin toss to decide whose name the race should take, trainer John Gosden - who is due to have five runners in the 238th Derby, including big fancy Cracksman - marvels at what was created.
""It's a unique track,"" he says, staring out over the course as it snakes its way up, down and around the Surrey Downs barely 15 miles south west of central London.
""Obviously Bunbury and Derby had had a very good lunch when they came up here and pegged it out and flipped a coin.
""It's a very demanding track. You have to stay, you have to have great dexterity, agility, balance and a turn of foot comes in very handy.
""It is a proper test of a horse - you wouldn't necessarily design it as a track for anything other than a rigorous test of a three-year-old in the first week of June, and that's what it is.""
Gosden, whose ever-powerful string based at Newmarket is the biggest threat to the prevailing dominance of Ireland's Aidan O'Brien, should know.
It's 20 years since he saddled Benny The Dip to win, and two since he masterminded Golden Horn's big-race success with Frankie Dettori riding in the silks of owner-breeder Anthony Oppenheimer.
Golden Horn, who by that point had won the regularly significant Dante Stakes at York, went on to stamp his authority on proceedings that season.
After Epsom, he galloped off with the Eclipse Stakes, the Irish Champion Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before suffering one of just two defeats, at the Breeders' Cup fixture in Kentucky.
Cracksman represents the same owner-trainer-jockey combination, and comes to Epsom with two wins from two starts, the second at Epsom when narrowly beating fellow Derby hopeful - and this year's Dante winner - Permian.
""Cracksman is not a Golden Horn,"" Gosden told BBC Sport, ""but he's a superior horse to Benny The Dip.
""He's still learning a lot, and when he came here and won the trial he grew up overnight, so we're excited.""
Believing there is no standout in this year's Derby, worth a total of nearly £1.625m - a record, Gosden fields three more runners than ever before.
Cracksman, who like fellow leading contender Eminent is a son of champion racehorse-turned-fledgling stallion Frankel, is joined by striking Goodwood winner Khalidi - added as a late entry, for £85,000 - plus three longer shots in Crowned Eagle, Glencadam Glory and Pealer.
A multitude of runners under a single, or near-single, banner is something of a feature of the 2017 staging of the world's best-known flat racing prize.
O'Brien - looking for a sixth win after Galileo, High Chaparral, Camelot, Ruler Of The World and Australia - saddles another formidable Coolmore-owned challenge.
Cliffs Of Moher, winner of the Dee Stakes at Chester, with Ryan Moore riding, leads six, ahead of well-supported Capri and Venice Beach. Douglas Macarthur, The Anvil - on which the trainer's apprentice jockey daughter Ana becomes the third female jockey to take part - and Wings Of Eagle make up the raiding party.
O'Brien's son Joseph, the jockey on board when Camelot and Australia were victorious but now training, saddles Rekindling.
Via his Godolphin operation and his son Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, owner Sheikh Mohammed is represented by Permian, Lingfield Trial winner Best Solution, once-raced Dubai Thunder and Benbatl, the Dante Stakes runner-up.
Strongly supported Eminent, sixth in the 2000 Guineas, trained by Martyn Meade and the mount of flat racing's champion jockey Jim Crowley, heads 'the rest'.
It does look genuinely wide open.
""We don't have any exceptional favourite standing out and frightening everyone away,"" said Gosden, whose father 'Towser' trained 1966 winner Charlottown as a two-year-old before ill health forced his own retirement.
""That's why we're winding up with a pretty big field. But I still think that the first three will be very, very good horses.
""The biggest problem is probably going to be for the jockeys getting around in a big field. You try riding around Epsom with so many other runners. It's not an easy job at all.""
Food for thought for apprentice jockey Paddy Pilley, who replaces Gina Mangan - barred from taking part on safety grounds - on 1,000-1 outsider Diore Lia.
However, the presence of Diore Lia, the large field and the chance for Frankel to father a first European Classic winner gives the whole thing an intriguing narrative.
It'll take a lot more than a spin of a coin to sort out this one.","It was, it can be argued, the most significant toss of a coin in British sporting history."
216,"Swansea's Indoor Market and bus station were also closed but officers reopened affected areas just before 17:00 BST.
South Wales Police had received reports of a suspect package at about 14:00.

218,"It marks the sixth time in four years that the web portal has announced sizeable job cuts.
The news coincides with plans by Skype to create about 400 new posts across five cities.
The internet video-calling business - which is owned by Microsoft - said it was initially looking to take on staff in London and Stockholm.
Other posts will later be created in Tallinn, Estonia; Prague, Czech Republic; and Palo Alto in California, US.
Yahoo said its cuts aimed to deliver a""smaller, nimbler, more profitable""company that was cheaper to run. It added that the action was designed to save about $375m (Â£236m) a year.
The move follows a period of turmoil at the firm.
Carol Bartz was dismissed as chief executive in September after failing to turn around the company's fortunes. Chairman Roy Bostock and co-founder Jerry Yang also later resigned from its board.
In January, former Paypal executive Scott Thompson was named the organisation's fourth chief executive in five years.
A recent study by the analytics company Comscore suggested that Yahoo's share of online search queries in the USfell below 14% for the first time in February, putting it further behind Google and Microsoft.
A statement issued by Mr Thompson's said: ""We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities. Our goal is to get back to our core purpose -putting our users and advertisers first - and we are moving aggressively to achieve that goal.""
It added that the firm would now focus on a ""deep"" personalised experience for users and a return on investment for investors.
The firm has not given any indication of when the cuts would be made. It said it would provide more information about its ""future direction"" when it released an earnings update on 17 April.
As Yahoo shrinks, Skype is growing. Once all the new positions are filled, the business expects to have 1,600 employees worldwide.
As part of the expansion it is launching a new technology centre in central London. It says the move would increase its headcount in the city by 40% to 330 posts.
The UK government's desire to monitor people using its services did not influence Skype's decision
It aims to have completed the first stage of the hiring process by the end of June.
Skype's vice-president of product and design told the BBC the new jobs would cover software engineering, product management and design.
""We have one project about 'big data', which is about making use of data that our users generate when using the product to improve the quality of the products we offer,"" said Rick Osterloh.
""We also a number of initiatives we are working on in the web area, and we are hiring some positions for our newly formed Xbox division.""
Skype's move signals that it is not overly concerned about the UK government's intention to give the country's security services increased access to internet data.
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has specifically identified Skype as one of the services that the government wants to be monitored.
A statement from Skype said that: ""We are not in a position to comment on the UK government's proposed legislation. We do of course comply with legislation in all countries in which we operate.""
Skype's use of peer-to-peer technology for its call and instant-messaging services means that it does not store the contents of communications on its servers, and so could not hand the information over unless it changed its systems.","Yahoo has confirmed it is axing about 2,000 posts, which amounts to 14% of its workforce being laid off."
219,"The Doncaster Central MP was one of three members to be chosen in a secret ballot, succeeding Natascha Engel who lost her seat at the election.
Labour's Lindsay Hoyle topped the ballot and was re-elected as chairman of ways and means. In that role, he will preside over Budget debates.
Tory Eleanor Laing was also re-elected as another deputy to John Bercow.
The Commons Speaker, who has held the role since 2009, was himself re-elected without a formal vote two weeks ago.
As he first stood for the Commons as a Conservative MP, Mr Bercow's deputies must be comprised of one Conservative and two opposition MPs to ensure balance.
Labour's Roberta Blackman-Woods was the only other candidate who stood in the election. Details of the number of votes each candidate got will be published later.
As no other Conservative candidate put their name forward, Mrs Laing was automatically chosen as first deputy chair of ways and means.

220,"Complaints about data collection by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 were put forward by campaign group Privacy International.
The ruling said some data collection did not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
But it added that proper statutory supervision was put in place last year.
It was a ""highly significant judgement"", Privacy International said.
As part of its review of the spy agencies' activities, the IPT examined the organisations' collection of communications data - involving the ""who, where, when, how and with whom"" was involved in conversations, but not their contents - and personal information about people.
Such data is ""vital for identifying and developing intelligence targets"", according to GCHQ.
Article 8 of the ECHR states, however, that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary.
""It is very significant,"" said Graham Smith of London law firm Bird & Bird.
He added that much of the data collection had been carried out under an older piece of law - section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984.
""It gave absolutely no clue at all that it could be used for this particular purpose,"" said Mr Smith.
""Everyone accepts that what the agencies do operationally has to be secret, but the laws that say what they can and can't do shouldn't be secret.""
An official policy about how such data collection should be carried out lawfully came into force in February 2015 - this was put into practice by the intelligence agencies later the same year.
It included guidance as to how collected data should be acquired, managed and destroyed
The tribunal found that, prior to this, personal datasets compiled by spy agencies did not comply with Article 8 and were therefore ""unlawful"".
""The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens,"" said the Home Office in a statement.
""We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes.""
It added that the government was ""committed"" to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers available to intelligence agencies.","UK spy agencies broke privacy rules by collecting large amounts of UK citizens' data without adequate oversight, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) has ruled."
221,"Another five soldiers were wounded in a rocket attack on Turkish tanks, the military said in a statement.
The fatalities are believed to be the first since Turkey launched its operation inside Syria two weeks ago.
Two fighters from the Free Syrian Army were also killed and another two injured in the attack.
""Two of our hero comrades were martyred and five were wounded in a rocket attack on two of our tanks by Daesh (IS) elements,"" the army statement said.
The rocket attack was launched near the village of al-Waqf, it added.
Syrian rebels backed by Turkey say they have recaptured a number of villages from IS since the Turkish operation - code-named Euphrates Shield - began.
The rebels have also retaken the key border town of Jarabulus.
On Sunday, Turkey said IS fighters were pushed out of their last positions along the Turkish-Syrian border.
Turkish forces have targeted IS inside Syria, but have also attacked Kurdish fighters in the same region.
The pursuit of the Kurdish YPG militia has led to criticism by Washington, which regards the Kurds as one of the most effective forces in the battle against IS.","Two Turkish soldiers have been killed by the Islamic State (IS) group in clashes in northern Syria, the Turkish army has said."
222,"A statue of General Robert E Lee was among those taken down from the Austin campus early on Monday.
Monuments to Confederate figures are symbols of ""modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism"", the college said.
A woman's death at a far-right rally in Charlottesville has reignited debate over America's racial legacy.
""Last week, the horrific displays of hatred at the University of Virginia and in Charlottesville shocked and saddened the nation,"" University of Texas at Austin President Greg Fenves said on Sunday.
""These events make it clear, now more than ever, that Confederate monuments have become symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism.""
As well as Lee, who was military commander during the 1861-65 American Civil War, a statue of another rebel general, Albert Sidney Johnston, and of Confederate postmaster John H Reagan were taken down.
They were moved to a centre for American history on campus.
A statue of Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg, who served from 1891-95, was also removed and will be considered for re-installation at another site.
""The University of Texas at Austin has a duty to preserve and study history,"" Mr Fenves continued.
""But our duty also compels us to acknowledge that those parts of our history that run counter to the university's core values, the values of our state and the enduring values of our nation do not belong on pedestals in the heart of the Forty Acres.""
The university removed a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis from its campus in 2015 following a mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
Mr Fenves added that he spoke with members of faculty, students and alumni following the deadly demonstrations in Virginia.
Dozens of schools and local governments have begun removing statues dedicated to the Confederacy, which was a pro-slavery rebellion against the federal government.
It follows violent clashes at a march on 12 August in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists and neo-Nazis protested against the removal of a monument of General Lee.
A 32-year-old woman was killed and nearly 20 people injured when a car was driven into a crowd of counter-protesters.
Last week, four Confederate-era statues were taken down in Baltimore, Maryland, while the governors of Virginia and North Carolina have ordered the removal of similar monuments in their states.
Recent removals of Confederate statues has sparked backlash among an outspoken group of Americans who view the statues as symbols of US history and southern culture.
President Donald Trump weighed in on the debate on Thursday, tweeting that controversial monuments are ""beautiful"", adding that they would be ""greatly missed"" from US cities.
But opponents argue the monuments serve as an offensive reminder of America's history of slavery and racial oppression.
""The historical and cultural significance of the Confederate statues on our campus - and the connections that individuals have with them - are severely compromised by what they symbolise,"" Mr Fenves said.
""Erected during the period of Jim Crow laws and segregation, the statues represent the subjugation of African Americans. That remains true today for white supremacists who use them to symbolise hatred and bigotry.",The University of Texas has removed four Confederate monuments overnight in the wake of violent clashes in Virginia earlier this month.

He had been taken to Staines police station and kept in restraints.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service.
The IPCC said two sergeants, one of whom had retired, and a health worker contracted to Surrey Police could face charges of gross negligence manslaughter and misconduct in public office.
It had investigated eight police officers and two staff,  the methods used to detain Mr Smith and why he was kept under restraint at the police station.
Police arrested Terry Smith, a father who lived locally, in Stanwell at about 22:00 GMT on 12 November 2013 after a call for assistance from an ambulance crew.

The judiciary said it was not appropriate for an active sheriff to be interviewed for the programme, but retired sheriff Peter Gillam gave the view from the bench. He served as a sheriff from 1991 until 2013, and said the variations reflected the independence of the judiciary.
He said: ""Obviously there is now, as I understand it, a board set up for advising on sentence to the judiciary.

""But variety is the spice of life and I think that it would be wrong to try to dragoon the judiciary into dealing with things which they believe to be the correct way of dealing with things.

228,"The 25-year-old batsman died from a haemorrhage in the brain two days after being hit on the neck during a match in Sydney on 25 November 2014.
The five-day hearing was convened to examine if his death was avoidable.
Some players giving testimony at the inquest have been accused of dishonesty for saying they could not recall many of the events of the day.
The inquest, which began on Monday at New South Wales Coroner's Court, heard evidence from players including Brad Haddin, Doug Bollinger and David Warner.
The court examined whether Hughes, batting for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales, had been targeted by short-pitch bowling, or had received unsettling comments from opponents.
Questions were also raised about whether a bowler told Hughes ""I'm going to kill you"" before he was fatally injured.
Hughes' parents walked out of the inquest as the counsel representing the family, Greg Melick SC, criticised the players for repeatedly answering many questions by saying ""no recollection"" or ""I can't recall"".
""At the end of the day, there was a plan, there was sledging, and short-pitched balls were bowled at Phillip Hughes, which increased the risk of an injury,"" Mr Melick said.
""Nine consecutive short-pitched balls from the one bowler aimed at leg stump or the body of the batsman was going too far.""
Suggestions of fabricated evidence were denied by the counsel representing Cricket Australia and its players.
Hughes' brother and sister later exited the inquest as the sworn statements from the players were defended.
The counsel assisting the coroner, Kristina Stern SC, said concerns about sledging and short balls were ""unnecessary"" and should not form part of the findings.
NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will deliver his finding from the inquest on 4 November.

More than 200 people from the rival Nuer community in Ethiopia's western Gambella province were killed in the 15 April raid.
Ethiopian forces crossed into South Sudan, encircling villages where the children were held.
However, the children were freed without any fighting after South Sudanese officials entered into negotiations with the abductors, the Ethiopian News Agency reports.
Negotiations would continue to free all the children, it reports.
""The children must be rescued and be reunited with their families. The cattle that was taken should also be handed over to the right owners,"" South Sudan's ambassador to Ethiopia, James Pitia Morgan, is quoted as saying.
Ethiopia shares a long border with South Sudan and cross-border raids involving the Murle and Nuer communities are not uncommon.
However, the scale of the 15 April shocked many people in both countries, and led to protests in Ethiopia's Gambella region with parents demanding greater protection for their children.

Critics complained then that a ""pure"" Japanese should have won.
Only about 2% of babies born every year in Japan are biracial, or ""haafu"", the Japanese word for half.
""We are Japanese,"" Ms Yoshikawa told AFP news agency. ""Yes, my dad is Indian and I'm proud of it, I'm proud that I have Indian in me. But that doesn't mean I'm not Japanese.""
She credited her win to Ms Miyamoto, saying she had helped show ""mixed girls the way"".
""Before Ariana, haafu girls couldn't represent Japan,"" said Ms Yoshikawa. ""That's what I thought too. Ariana encouraged me a lot by showing me and all mixed girls the way.
""I know a lot of people who are haafu and suffer,"" she said. ""When I came back to Japan, everyone thought I was a germ.""
""Like if they touched me they would be touching something bad. But I'm thankful because that made me really strong.""
A few years ago, a woman of Indian descent, Nina Davuluri, faced Twitter abuse after being crowned Miss America. Some called her an ""Arab"", some a ""terrorist"", and some an ""Arab terrorist"". Indians, in large numbers, came to her defence.
Now, Ms Yoshikawa is being criticised for having an Indian father and some Indians have taken to social media to advise the Japanese to ""get over it"". One Twitter user said she won because she ""must have deserved it"" while another said ""after Gautam Buddha, Ms Yoshikawa is the only Indian to make it big in Japan"".
In Ms Yoshikawa's case - as in Ms Davuluri's before her - the biggest complaint seems to be the ""lack of purity"". But some are wondering whether this debate over purity has any relevance in today's globalised world.
As one Twitter user said: ""Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, colour, gender or country of origin.""
The pageant winner, also an avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, said that she hoped to change perceptions.
""When I'm abroad, people never ask me what mix I am. As Miss Japan, hopefully I can help change perceptions so that it can be the same here too.""
Ms Yoshikawa's win did not trigger the backlash that Ms Miyamoto received on social media.
There were however, several on Twitter that expressed unhappiness.
""It's like we're saying a pure Japanese face can't be a winner,"" said one user.
""What's the point of holding a pageant like this now? Zero national characteristics,"" another complained.
Ms Yoshikawa however, was not letting the doubters get to her.
""There was a time as a kid when I was confused about my identity,"" she said. ""But I've lived in Japan so long now I feel Japanese.""","A half-Indian woman has been crowned Miss World Japan, the second year in a row a biracial person has won a beauty pageant in the country."

233,"The Labour leader told ITV it was ""impossible"" for members of his top team to remain in place if they rebelled against a three-line whip.
Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens quit last week over the issue - other senior MPs say they will rebel.
Mr Corbyn has ordered all Labour MPs to support the bill triggering Article 50.
Labour backed the campaign to keep the UK in the EU in the referendum in June and many Labour MPs represent constituencies which voted for Remain.
But many seats which voted to leave the EU are also represented by Labour MPs.
Mr Corbyn says he understands the pressures on MPs in pro-Remain constituencies but has called on them to unite around the important issues.
His shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has said that, since a UK-wide referendum with a 72% turnout returned a vote in favour of withdrawing from the EU, it would ""be very undermining of democracy"" for MPs to vote against beginning the formal process of leaving.
Ms Stevens quit on Friday saying Brexit was a ""terrible mistake"". Shadow minister Tulip Siddiq also quit last week saying she would vote against the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.
Two Labour whips, Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire, who are in charge of party discipline, have also said they will rebel - though they have not resigned.
Another shadow minister Daniel Zeichner has said he will vote against the bill, as will other MPs including former Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw.
Mr Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""There was no need for anyone to resign at this stage. It's obviously impossible to carry on being in the shadow cabinet if you vote against a decision made after a very frank and very long discussion of the shadow cabinet earlier this week.""
Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has said divisions in the party will be handled sensitively and suggested some rebels could be back in senior roles ""within months"".
The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was introduced after the Supreme Court ruled that parliament - not just the government alone - must vote to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the formal process of the UK leaving the EU.
Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to begin the formal process of leaving by the end of March.
The bill is due to be debated by MPs on Tuesday - in a sitting that may last until midnight - and clear the Commons on 8 February, after which it will move to the House of Lords.
Labour has demanded changes including giving the Commons a vote on the final Brexit deal before European leaders or MEPs consider it.
The Liberal Democrats have vowed to oppose the triggering of Article 50 unless there is a guarantee of another referendum on the final Brexit deal that is agreed with Brussels, while the SNP has vowed to table 50 amendments to the legislation.",Jeremy Corbyn has warned shadow cabinet ministers not to expect to stay in their jobs if they vote against starting the process of leaving the EU.
234,"He felt a problem after coming on as a second-half substitute at St James' Park and a scan showed a strain.
It is the latest in a long line of injury absences for the 26-year-old, who had just returned to action after knee and foot problems.
Sturridge has made six appearances so far this season, scoring four goals.
Having scored 28 times for Liverpool and England in 2013-14, he was restricted to just 18 appearances last season because of thigh, calf and hip injuries.
After recovering from a hip operation in May, Sturridge played three games at the start of this term but then did not feature from 4 October until 29 November.
He scored twice in the 6-1 League Cup quarter-final win at Southampton last Wednesday but was hurt at Newcastle after coming on in the 62nd minute.
When a foot problem picked up in training forced him to miss the Reds' Europa League win over Bordeaux on 26 November, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said Sturridge had to learn ""what is serious pain and what is only pain"".

235,"President Joko Widodo proposed the changes in May following the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl.
The laws were subject to fierce debate in parliament, with two opposition parties voting against castration.
Human rights groups have objected to the punishments, arguing that violence will not be stopped by violence.
The Indonesian Doctors Association said administering chemical castration would violate its professional ethics and said its members should not take part.
The procedure entails injecting convicts with female hormones. It is used on sex offenders in Poland, South Korea, Russia, and some US states, among others. Prisoners in UK jails can volunteer for the treatment.
The new laws also allow judges to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and applies a 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes.
Human rights groups including the National Commission for Women (NCW) criticised the laws and called for them to be re-evaluated each year to test whether they are a deterrent.
Azriana, the head of the NCW, said: ""Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. Also it's a very expensive procedure and what we should be spending and investing our money in is services to support and help the victims.""
Dr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, said the administration was ""praying"" that the punishments ""will have the desired effect"".
She said: ""Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip. These are now law, so even if you hate the idea of them everyone now has to support this.""
The punishments follow a number of high profile cases of child sexual abuse in the country. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing three children at a Jakarta kindergarten.
And earlier this year, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a cardboard box in Jakarta after she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and killed.","Indonesia's parliament has passed controversial laws authorising chemical castration, minimum sentences and execution for convicted paedophiles."
236,"The 17-year-old fell some 40m (130ft) into a dry riverbed below. The teenager had been in a group from the Netherlands and Belgium staying at a nearby surf camp.
Last month, British tourist Kleyo De Abreu died in a bungee jump off a bridge near Granada, southern Spain.
She suffered fatal injuries when she hit the wall of the bridge below her.
A police spokesman told Dutch media that the latest ""ghastly accident"" may have been caused by carelessness, although it was unclear what had gone wrong.
The teenager had been taking part in a type of bungee jump known as ""puenting"", which involves diving with two cords attached, and then swinging beneath the bridge or viaduct.
Bungee jumping has become extremely popular in Spain in recent years, both among locals and foreign tourists.
Spectacular settings in rural areas of Andalusia in the south, or Cantabria and the Pyrenees in the north are common destinations both for bungee aficionados and first-timers.
Companies offer both bungee jumping and its bridge-swinging variant, ""puenting"".
There have been around 10 deaths linked to bungee jumping since it took off in the 1980s. Prior to the two fatalities this summer, the most recent was that of a 48-year-old man at Robledo de Chavela, near Madrid, in 2013.
How to check your jump is safe
Local police chief Joaquin Gonzalez said he had not known that puenting took place on the bridge, adding that it was ""extremely risky"".
The jump took place from the top of a bridge over the A8 road at Cabezon de la Sal in Cantabria.
Mayor Isabel Fernandez told Dutch TV that it was an enormous tragedy. ""The girl was so young. We're ready to help her family as much as we can.""",A Dutch teenage girl has been killed while bungee jumping from a viaduct near Santander in northern Spain.
237,"Archaeologists working for the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) found the walled enclosure under the lawn in the South Ayrshire castle's Fountain Court.
NTS said it probably functioned as a kitchen garden from about 1733 to 1782.
As was the fashion in the late 18th Century, a new walled garden was then built out of sight from the house.
This would have allowed the former site to be landscaped to improve the views from the castle.
Derek Alexander, head of archaeological services for the NTS, said: ""Although it was marked on the estate map, until now we never knew that any of it survived below the immaculate turf of the Fountain Court.
""This work has given us the perfect opportunity to explore a hidden aspect of Culzean's past and, once the lawn is re-seeded, I can't imagine the gardeners will want us digging more holes!""
The garden is thought to be from work undertaken by Sir John Kennedy of Culzean, 2nd Baronet, in 1733.
It can be seen on an estate map of Culzean drawn by John Foulis in 1755.
The garden was abandoned in 1782 and the walls were demolished by Robert Adam's workmen as part of a wide range of improvements carried out around the castle.
The drainage works, currently being carried out at Fountain Court, aim to make it suitable for staging large public events.",Remains of an 18th Century garden have been found at Culzean Castle during excavation works to install a new drainage system.
238,"The landmark figure was reached in March - nine months ahead of schedule.
It follows decades of global efforts and investment to get antiretroviral drugs to those in need - such as people living in sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2000, when the UN first set goals to combat HIV, fewer than 700,000 people were receiving these vital medicines.
According to UN Aids, which has a report out today, the global response to HIV has averted 30 million new HIV infections and nearly eight million Aids-related deaths since the millennium.
Over the same time frame, new HIV infections have fallen from 2.6 million per year to 1.8 million, and Aids-related deaths have gone down from 1.6 million to 1.2 million.
Meanwhile, global investment in HIV has gone up from £3.1bn ($4.8bn) in 2000 to more than £13bn ($20bn) in 2014.
And concerted action over the next five years could end the Aids epidemic by 2030, says UN Aids.
But progress has been slower in some areas.
A major gap seems to be in awareness of HIV status, which is the biggest barrier to treatment access, says the report.
And treatment access for children has lagged behind adults - although this is now improving.
The proportion of children living with HIV who receive antiretroviral therapy almost doubled between 2010 and 2014 (from 14% to 32%), but coverage ""remains notably lower than it does for adults"", says the report.
Even though new HIV infections have gone down, there is still an unacceptable number of new HIV infections each year, contributing to the burden of the epidemic.
In 2014, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of all new HIV infections. And at the last headcount, there were an estimated 25.8 million people in this region living with HIV. The estimated count for the whole world was 36.9 million.
This year sees the switch from Millennium Development Goals to broader Sustainable Development Goals.
Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations said: ""The world has delivered on halting and reversing the Aids epidemic.
""Now we must commit to ending the Aids epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.""
The report says the next five years will be critical and recommends front-loading investment to ""sprint"" towards an ambition of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030.","The goal to get HIV treatment to 15 million people by the end of 2015 has already been met, says the United Nations Aids agency."

240,"Official figures showed the value of sales rose by 0.1% north of the border between January and March, compared with 0.3% for the UK.
Sales volumes were up by 0.7% - compared with a UK figure of 0.8%.
The Scottish Retail Sales Index also showed that the volume of sales in Scotland went up by 2.7% over the year, while the value rose by just 0.1%.
Scottish Retail Consortium director David Lonsdale said the return to growth was encouraging, but added there was  a ""continuing fragility"" in consumer confidence which was affecting retailers.
He urged the next Scottish government to prioritise policies which encouraged investment and expansion in the sector.
Mr Lonsdale said: ""The prospects for retailers are ultimately determined by the state of the economy and their own ability to adapt and seize on the opportunities that arise.
""Our new MSPs can help by channelling their collective energies into ensuring that the retail industry, Scotland's largest private-sector employer, is even better-placed to be able to invest, expand and create jobs.""
Euan Murray, of Barclays Corporate Banking in Scotland, said the ""measured increase"" in the volume of sales in the first quarter had been mainly driven by food sales, in contrast with the previous three months.
He added: ""We are continuing to see non-food retailers benefit from a strong online offering with more value-conscious consumers comparing prices online to secure the best bargains.
""We would expect to see the online retail space continue to become ever more important as we move forward.""
Recent industry figures suggested Scotland's retailers experienced a mixed month in March.
The SRC-KPMG monitor found total sales for the five weeks to 2 April were 1.3% lower than the same period last year.
The non-food category saw household goods such as furniture and flooring doing well.
But fashion and footwear registered its worst decline since May last year.

In a statement his family said he was a ""very competent skier and snowboarder"".
His family said they were skiing together when Carwyn's sister ""lost her ski on a jump"" and Carwyn skied ahead.
The accident happened in Flaine, 38 miles north west of Chamonix.
In their statement released through the Foreign Office, the family described Carwyn as an ""adorable, caring person"" who learned to ski from the age of three.
The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day on Friday afternoon.
It said: ""The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead.
""The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts.
""The family would like to thank all their friends and family for their support at this time and the vast help from the British Consulate.""
Police chief Patrick Poirot, head of the mountain rescue division in the nearby town of Annecy, said yesterday that police believed the boy did not know where to go after losing his parents and skied in the wrong direction.
He said: ""He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff.
""He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell.""
The family have a farm in the small village of Talybont-on-Usk in the Brecon Beacons, where Carwyn's parents Ceri and Rhys run an award-winning produce business and rent holiday cottages.
Liam Fitzpatrick, an independent county councillor for the village, said the community was ""in absolute shock"".
""He was seven years old, it's horrendous. A tragic, tragic accident,"" he said.
""We just can't comprehend it.
""It's a small village and everyone knows each other, especially his parents who are well-known because of their business.

His brother, Alan Ryan, was killed in 2012. Both men had been well known to Irish police.
It is believed Vincent Ryan was shot in the head, throat and chest. He later died in hospital.
Irish police (gardai) have begun a murder inquiry.
Vincent Ryan has also been described by police as a well-known dissident republican.
A burnt-out vehicle was found near the scene of the shooting.

247,"Pippa McManus, 15, weighed about 4st (25kg) when she was being treated at The Priory in Altrincham.
She was released in December 2015 and later died after stepping in front of a train near Stockport.
A lack of support available to her family contributed to her death, Stockport Coroner's Court heard.
The jury returned a conclusion of suicide but found the care plan when Ms McManus was discharged was inadequate and there was not enough communication with the family about her suicide risk.
Inadequate community care and specialist support and a lack of cohesiveness amongst agencies were also contributory factors to her death, the court heard.
Speaking after the conclusion, her mother Marie said there should have been more help available and ""too many of our children are dying from this terrible illness"".
""Effective treatment is needed more quickly and if this had been available to our beautiful daughter, maybe she would still be alive today, maybe we would not have needed this inquest,"" she said.
Paula Stanford, hospital director at The Priory, said: ""Our heartfelt sympathies are with Pip's family and we will now carefully consider the findings of the jury.""
During the inquest, the hospital said her anorexia was one of the most severe cases it had seen.
The coroner, Andrew Bridgman, said he will write to all of the agencies involved in her care.
The inquest heard Ms McManus had a history of self-harming and had previously written a number of goodbye notes to her family, doctor, and The Priory hospital.
By the age of 13, she had been diagnosed with severe anorexia and was obsessed with diet and exercise and in September 2014, was sectioned and treated at The Priory.
She was released in December 2015, by which time she was not considered high risk, though she remained under hospital care.
But following a family row five days later, the teenager walked to Gatley train station near her home and killed herself.
Her father, Jim, said his daughter's anorexia ""had too strong of a grip.""
""She used to say she had bad thoughts and wasn't allowed to do things - she couldn't even lick an ice-cream. She'd turn around and say I'm not allowed.
""Whatever was going on in her head was so strong she just couldn't comply.""
Her mother, Marie, said it ""was just horrific"" and ""a nightmare.""
""[Pippa] hated herself. She thought she was the ugliest person in the world. Whatever you said, it didn't make a difference because that's what the anorexia was telling her.
""We needed some trained mental health workers to work with us but they weren't there to do that... We were let down by everybody I think. Everybody had a part to play.""
Deborah Coles, director of INQUEST, a charity that supported the family during the court process, said her parents' ""concerns were dismissed and minimised throughout"".
""Pip's death has exposed a mental health system which pushed through the discharge of a highly vulnerable child without any of the support or care in place to make sure she would be safe,"" she said.","No adequate care plan was in place for an anorexic teenager who killed herself five days after being released from a psychiatric hospital, an inquest found."

All four secondary schools in Dumfries are being rebuilt or refurbished under the Learning Town scheme.
A new ""learning hub"" with room for more than 300 students is also being built.

It said the new combined capacity of secondary schools would be ""more than enough"" to meet the needs of the town.
Figures for the primary schools show all of them would have a maximum intake set at or above their 20-year average except for schools planned to move to new sites.
The school rolls at St Ninian's and Lochside will be combined from August 2018 while figures for Loreburn Primary have been based on plans to move it to part of a central campus including Dumfries Academy.

252,"European leaders gathered in the Polish port of Gdansk for a midnight ceremony at the site where the first shots of the war were fired.
The Gdansk commemoration was seen as a slight to Russia's Victory Parade on Saturday, which has been boycotted by Western leaders because of Ukraine.
There will also be ceremonies in Paris, London, Berlin, as well as Washington.
The commemoration in Gdansk was marked with a 21-gun salute on the stroke of midnight. Beams of light illuminated a monument to Polish defenders in Westerplatte and the national anthem was played.
In a speech, Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski said the war had started with the co-operation of two totalitarian regimes led by Hitler and Stalin.
He went on to say that the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945 did not bring freedom but instead communism and the Iron Curtain. Such division finally ended, the president said, with the integration of the region into the European Union.
The event was attended by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the presidents of several countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania and Ukraine.
But many other Western leaders - who are boycotting Moscow's event and for whom the Gdansk commemoration was partly organised - did not attend.
Among those in Gdansk was Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko who said it was possible to draw parallels from history and the current situation in Europe.
""Annexation and invasion, under the pretext of defending ethnic minorities... could all become the new reality,"" he said.
Relations between Russia and the West have been soured by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula last year and support for rebels in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Moscow denies it is arming the rebels and sending troops across the border.
Russia, which lost more citizens to the war than any other nation, will stage its biggest-ever military parade during its Victory ceremony in Moscow's Red Square on Saturday.
Later on Friday, there will be a ceremony in Germany where President Joachim Gauck will lay a wreath at a cemetery for Soviet soldiers. The German parliament will meet in special session.
In London, a remembrance service will be held at the Cenotaph and 200 beacons will later be lit across the country.
In France, where VE (Victory in Europe) Day is a national holiday, President Francois Hollande will lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
In the US, a ceremony will be held at the national World War Two memorial in Washington followed by a flypast of vintage fighter planes.
It was on 8 May 1945 that Allied forces accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, marking the end of the war in Europe. But it was not the end of WW2.

Chairman of AFC Bournemouth Jeff Mostyn was among the first to congratulate Arter and his partner Rachel, tweeting: ""Thrilled with the incredible news.""
Their daughter Renee was stillborn in December 2015.
AFC Bournemouth also congratulated Arter on the news, tweeting: ""From one family to another, congratulations.""
Arter responded to the support on Twitter, saying: ""Thank you to everyone for all of your kind messages"", adding an emoji rainbow and a heart.
""Rainbow baby"" is a phrase used by some parents who have lost a child through a miscarriage or stillbirth as they compare their subsequent child to a beautiful sight after a storm.
TV cameras caught an emotional moment after Bournemouth's match against Manchester City on Monday when City manager Pep Guardiola embraced Arter and offered his best wishes for the imminent birth.
Arter said at the time: ""He's someone I have massive respect for. I watched his Barcelona teams and he is, without doubt, the best manager in the world.""
Messages have also been sent to the couple from numerous other clubs and fans.

254,"The former Northern Ireland international, who died last week, was remembered with a minute's applause and a video tribute following a career that saw him score more than 140 goals for the club.
On the pitch, however, the Bantams were looking for a response to the loss at Roots Hall and they started in positive fashion.
Mark McNulty and Nicky Law each had shots deflected for corners and Bradford twice appealed in vain for a penalty, with Hanson and McNulty both going down inside the area to no avail.
The hosts continued to press after the interval as Haris Vuckic and Law went close before the home side's pressure paid off in the 56th minute.
Vuckic's overhit cross from the right was kept in play by Mark Marshall, who clipped the ball into the area where Hanson scored with a header from close range.
However, Northampton came close to equalising when only a brilliant one-handed save by Colin Doyle kept out Alex Revell's header from Paul Anderson's cross, before substitute Marc Richards had the ball in the net in the 84th minute only to be ruled offside.

255,"The ""truly wicked, marauding mob"" stabbed Sean McHugh, 19,  with a ""sword stick"" in Anfield on 30 September 2013.
Reese O'Shaughnessy, 19, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years after he was convicted alongside four others.
Andrew Hewitt, 15, Keyfer Dykstra, Corey Hewitt and Joseph McGill, all 14, were also detained by Liverpool Crown Court.
Dykstra was sentenced to a minimum of 12 years, Andrew Hewitt and McGill were sentenced to a minimum of nine years and Corey Hewitt for a minimum of six years.
Judge Clement Goldstone described Mr McHugh's killers as ""a marauding mob"".
""Each of you has been convicted of the murder of Sean McHugh - a truly wicked attack in which each of you played different roles,"" Justice Goldstone said.
A victim impact statement from Mr McHugh's mother Lorraine that was read in court said: ""They might as well have killed me.""
The teenagers were part of a gang known as the Lane Heads, a rival gang to the Walton Village Heads which Mr McHugh was linked to.
Months earlier, Dykstra was stabbed in the chest by a member of the Walton Village Heads and wanted to ""avenge that stabbing"", the court heard.
""The stabbing was avenged not by attacking the person responsible, but by attacking someone... by virtue of his affiliation to the Walton Village Heads,"" Justice Goldstone said.
The gang targeted Mr McHugh, of Beckett Street, Liverpool, after a minor dispute and found him at the Priory Road launderette, where he had left his washing, at about 19:00 BST.
Armed with knives and the makeshift sword stick, described as similar to a broom handle but with a blade attached, the gang forced the back door to the room where Mr McHugh was hiding.
He was beaten and stabbed before the group ran out.
Mr McHugh escaped and was found in an alleyway having been stabbed in the groin. He died a few days later in hospital from blood loss.",Five teenagers who murdered a man in a Liverpool launderette when some of them were 13 years old have been sentenced.
256,"Serial burglar Darren February, 34 and of no fixed address, denies breaking into Mr Cowell's west London home while he was asleep in December 2015.
Isleworth Crown Court heard traces of Mr February's DNA was discovered on a glove found dropped nearby.
It was also found on a mark on the side of the entrance steps, the court heard.
A forensic expert said the discovery meant it was possible that the defendant, who has been convicted of 37 burglaries, wore the gloves to steal a diamond ring, earrings and watches, before discarding them near the Holland Park home.
Traces of other people's DNA were also found on the items tested, expert Sara Short said.
In their report Ms Short and Rachel Pollard found that while ""one possible explanation is that he had worn the gloves and discarded them"" on 4 December, 2015, they could not conclusively state that he had ""handled, worn or had direct contact with the gloves or had contact with the area (on the wall).""
In cross examination, Ms Short agreed it was possible the defendant's DNA could have been transferred on to the gloves without him having worn them.
But she agreed with prosecutor Denis Barry who suggested it would be unlucky for the defendant to have his DNA transferred to and found at the scene, if he had never been there or committed the crime.
The court heard from a police officer who said he initially thought a man who broke in to the home of singer Rita Ora was pictured on CCTV from Mr Cowell's address.
Two other officers said they had been able to identify Mr February from images captured at the scene.
The trial continues.","DNA of a man accused of stealing Â£1m worth of jewellery from Simon Cowell's house was found on a glove at the music mogul's home, a court has heard."

The Dons took the lead when Jonny Hayes' corner landed at the near post, with Caley Thistle's Gary Warren deflecting in Ash Taylor's shot.
Greg Tansey headed wide for the visitors, while Hayes, Kenny McLean and Niall McGinn all missed for the Dons.
Miles Storey should have made it 2-0 but somehow got the ball caught under his feet on the goal line.
The result moves Aberdeen 13 points clear of third-placed Rangers, with the two sides set to meet on Sunday at Pittodrie.
Aberdeen may have been unable to mount a serious title challenge this season, but they are still on course for a record points tally after surpassing the run of home wins set by Sir Alex Ferguson's side in 1986.
They now need 12 points from the last seven matches to do that, but an overall run of 12 victories in their last 14 Premiership matches suggests they are up to the task.
Aberdeen impressed with their pace, intensity and variety of movement going forward in the first half, but the defence remains equally effective as they have now gone 531 minutes without conceding a goal.
Of course this was another painful night for Caley Thistle manager Richie Foran in what has been a steep learning curve for the Dubliner in his first season in the job.
No team in British senior football have won fewer league matches than the Highlanders this season and, while they are not yet entirely cut adrift at the bottom, time is fast running out to turn things around.
The sight of five former Caley Thistle players in such an impressive Dons squad was compounded by the knowledge that current top league marksman Greg Tansey is moving to Pittodrie in the summer.
The midfielder is desperate to leave with the club still in the Premiership, but he missed one of their best chances of the evening when he headed a Henri Anier cross over the bar from six yards in the first half.
The real disappointment for Foran, though, will be that the goal they conceded was a gift for Aberdeen.
It was poor marking by the Caley Thistle defence as Dons pair Taylor and Andrew Considine contested a Hayes corner, the ball eventually deflected in by captain Warren off Taylor's strike.
Despite a battling performance, Caley Thistle simply could not find a way back into the match.
They did have a late let off, though, when former Inverness player Storey had an incredible miss when he failed to convert from point-blank range after a Hayes shot came off the post.
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: ""We didn't have the same rhythm or flow to our game as we normally have, but there were a number of factors for that as we had the game in our pocket but didn't know whether to stick or twist.
""We are delighted to get the 10th home win on the bounce for the first time since that great Aberdeen side in 1986 with so many top players and a top manager in Sir Alex Ferguson.
""That keeps the distance between us and Rangers and we just look forward to playing them here on Sunday now but we have a lot of hard games left.""
Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We had chances to go one up but we didn't take them then we give a goal from a set-piece which was really disappointing.
""We work hard on defending those so it was a sloppy goal to give away and Aberdeen looked more confident than we did.
""We are not going to be judged on games against Aberdeen though. We have seven must win games left and I believe we can still get enough points to get out of trouble.""

Thousands of households have lost power and Japan's two largest airlines have suspended many flights.
The storm also forced the suspension of the search for people missing after last week's volcanic eruption.
The storm-tracking website Tropical Storm Risk forecasts that Phanfone will rapidly lose power over the next few hours as it goes further into the Pacific Ocean.
Typhoon Phanfone was downgraded from an earlier status of a super typhoon, but the Japan Meteorological Agency had warned it was still a dangerous storm.
Japan averages 11 typhoons a year, according to its weather agency.
The typhoon made landfall on Monday morning near the central city of Hamamatsu, with winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph).
The airman was one of three US military personnel swept away by high waves whipped up by the typhoon off southern Okinawa island, where the US has a large military base. The remaining two are still missing.

262,"Allen scored his first international goal on his 32nd appearance in Wales' 4-0 win over Moldova in their opening 2018 World Cup qualifier.
The 26-year-old joined Stoke City from Liverpool for £13m in July after only starting eight league games in 2015-16.
""I think it had come to the point where I needed to move on,"" Allen said.
""Personally, it was pretty obvious.
""Any player will tell you regular football makes tonnes of difference to the way you perform and the way you feel out on the football pitch.
""It comes to a certain stage in your career where if it's not happening then you have to go and seek it out.
""Hopefully I will get much more game time now and I think that is going to be really important for me in my international career as well.""
The Wales international joined Liverpool from Swansea City for £15m in the summer of 2012. He had a year left on his contract at Anfield but joined Stoke after starring for Wales at Euro 2016.
Allen has been impressed by the calibre of players fellow Welshman Mark Hughes' has assembled at Stoke City.
Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony signed on a season-long loan on transfer deadline day and joins a squad which includes Xherdan Shaqiri, Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic.
""It's pretty obvious that my type of play would not have suited Stoke years ago,"" Allen added
""But the likes of Shaqiri, Arnautovic, Bojan, (Ibrahim) Afellay and (Giannelli) Imbula, players they have brought in - and others that were already there (Glenn) Whelan, Jonathan (Walters) and (Peter) Crouch - the list went on and on.

263,"And, on a drive between the Republican Convention in Cleveland, Ohio and the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, I gained an insight into another factor adding to the unpredictability - the growing numbers of Americans who are switching, or thinking of switching, party allegiances. In some cases, they are changing the voting habits of a lifetime.
The first switcher was just a few blocks from the Republican convention location. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. A lifelong Republican, he believes that Mr Trump is not just telling tall stories, but dangerous ones.
""I am very concerned about any leader who appeals to the worst instincts of human nature. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party.""
So will he vote for Hillary Clinton? ""I may. I haven't quite got there, but I definitely won't vote for Donald Trump. Anyone who knows me knows how ridiculous that sounds, that I would even think of voting for her.""
I heard a very different view in the run-down town of Warren, 50 miles east of Cleveland. At the 422 restaurant, the only place to eat on what local people say was once a bustling strip, I met a group of disillusioned Democrats. They used to work at the town's steel mill, which is now nothing more than a fenced-off patch of wasteland.
As jobs, opportunities and hopes have disappeared, so too has the loyalty they felt - or were encouraged to feel by the unions - towards the Democratic Party. During the 35 years that Joe Shrodek worked in the mill's blast furnace, he always voted for Democratic presidential candidates. But not this time.
""When I was there I voted Democrat the whole time, the unions endorsed [the candidate]. All that's gone now. I just want change, that's all. They need to clean house in Washington.""
So, is Mr Trump the man to do that?
""I don't know,"" he says, ""but I'm voting for him.""
Watching Joe and his friends mop up the restaurant's roasted hot pepper dip with slices of white bread, local Republican Party chairman Randy Law predicts that Mr Trump will soak up the votes of many other white working class voters like them.
""I see it every day. People calling me, emailing me. There is this anti-Hillary feeling. People seeing it as a third term for Obama. People are fed up with a lot of those policies that have hurt big business, small business and trade and people are tired of being politically correct.""
Crossing the state line into Pennsylvania, another swing state, where polls suggest a tight contest, I encountered a different type of switcher. Judie Radel, who owns the Yee Haw farm in Duncannon, has always voted Democrat. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. Patting her ""girls"" - the milk cows she tends on the 160 acres she farms - she says that she's leaning Republican.
""I don't trust Hillary. We've had eight years of a Hillary administration and I think we need change.""
She says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. ""I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. Our country's in dire straits right now. We need to wake up.""
She expresses some misgivings about a Trump finger on the nuclear button, but doesn't think it disqualifies him from the White House.
An hour south-east of Yee Haw farm, in Pennsylvania's more affluent Lancaster County, Ann Womble is rather more concerned. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa.
But the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. She dismisses comparisons between the reality TV star, Donald Trump, and the Hollywood actor, Ronald Reagan, who first attracted her to the party.
""Reagan's candidacy was a sunny, happy conservative insurgency into the Republican Party, because it was optimistic. Now, we're in the opposite place. Trump is attracting people to his candidacy for dark, gloomy and dangerous reasons.
""His view is of an autocratic, almost Third World leader. If he were actually president of the United States and tweeting these things that he tweets all hours of the day, saying these things to camera, it could be apocalyptic.""
But, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. Although she'll support Republican candidates for Congress, she may not vote in the presidential election at all.
And that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party.
While disillusioned Democrats are embracing Mr Trump, disillusioned Republicans find it much harder to support his opponent. Mrs Clinton's convention may project a positive vision of America. But to really succeed it needs to address and counter the negative impression that many Americans have of her.","Donald Trump's nomination as the US Republican Party's presidential candidate has been a huge shock to the American political establishment, confounding the forecasts and questioning the models for predicting the outcome of November's election."

267,"The figures for the Walmart-owned supermarket, filed at Companies House, confirm a torrid spell for Asda as it faced stiff competition in the grocery sector.
Like-for-like sales were down 5.7% compared with the previous year.
Pre-tax profits dropped almost 19% to Â£791.7m at the Leeds-based company.
""The grocery market has continued to experience low growth throughout the year and competition in the sector has remained intense. Our sales performance, relative to the market, was behind our expectations,"" the company said.
Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - the so-called big four UK supermarkets - also face competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Asda suffered more than most and, unlike others, has struggled to fight back. In May, it reported decreasing sales in the first quarter of 2017 - the 11th consecutive quarter of falls - as it continued to lose ground to its rivals.
However, Asda added that despite the disappointing results, there had been an improvement following ""strategic changes"" under new boss Sean Clarke.
Mr Clarke, who replaced previous chief executive Andy Clarke a year ago, has slashed the prices of everyday items as he attempts to arrest falling sales.
The chain reported a 2.8% fall in like-for-like sales in its first quarter of this year, a moderate improvement on the previous period, which saw sales fall 2.9%.
Analysts have said that a major turnaround is required at Asda.
""Sainsbury's and Tesco have always had more opportunity for differentiation from the discounters, but Asda has chosen to focus on price rather than range and in-store experience, which has clearly been the wrong strategy,"" said Tom Berry, retail analyst at GlobalData.
""Asda has been flailing without direction for too long, and a comprehensive plan is needed if it is to survive in the highly competitive UK grocery market.""
Phil Dorrell, of consultancy Retail Remedy, is a previous marketing chief at Asda. He said that it was a difficult market for Asda and it ""had a lot of catching up to do"".
""It is not changing significantly or fast enough to pull around the results. It did not get its proposition right,"" he said.",Sales falls and lower profits at supermarket Asda in 2016 have been revealed in detail in newly-filed accounts.
268,"Five guards are also missing and are believed to have aided the mass prison breakout in Nuevo Laredo town.
Mexican police say the majority of those on the run are drug traffickers and members of armed gangs.
The prison system is struggling to cope with an influx of offenders arrested in a campaign against drugs cartels.
Correspondents say prison breakouts are not uncommon in northern Mexico, where more than 400 inmates have escaped since January 2010.
Nuevo Laredo, in Tamaulipas state, lies just across the border from Laredo, Texas.
The largest jail break so far was last December when more than 140 prisoners escaped from the same prison.
According to a statement from the Tamaulipas state government, the riot began on Friday morning in Nuevo Laredo's Sanctions Enforcement Centre, which houses an estimated 1,200 prisoners.
After the breakout, soldiers surrounded the jail and calm was restored, the authorities said.
The northern border region is the scene of rising lawlessness as the cartels fight the security forces and each other for control of smuggling routes into the US.
The main battle in Tamaulipas is between the Zetas and the Gulf cartels, the AFP news agency reports.
Their capacity for violence and ability to pay huge bribes gives them considerable power to subvert the prison system and get their people out.
President Felipe Calderon came to power in 2006 promising a war on drugs.
More than 35,000 people have died in drug violence since he began his campaign, which has involved launching an army assault on drug gangs.","Seven prisoners have been killed and 59 others have escaped after a riot at a jail in northern Mexico near the US border, officials say."
269,"The play, written by Jack Thorne, is set 19 years after the seventh and final book in the series by JK Rowling.
It opens officially at the Palace Theatre, in London's West End, on Saturday.
Audiences have been urged to ""keep the secrets"" since the play began previews in early June.
Presented in two parts, the play - showing the stars of the wizarding saga as adults in their mid-30s as their own children head off to school - stretches over five hours.
Daily Telegraph critic Dominic Cavendish awarded the play five stars, writing: ""British theatre hasn't known anything like it for decades and I haven't seen anything directly comparable in all my reviewing days.""
He said ""those involved can give themselves a pat on the back"", adding: ""It's a triumph. Not an unqualified one - there are some quibbles - but in all key respects, it grips, it stirs, it delights.""
Cavendish praises the ""thrill-a-minute"" stage craft which sees pupils heading to Hogwarts, at the start of the play, change into school uniforms ""in the blink of an eye"" as they head to the infamous Platform 9Â¾ to make their way to school.
The Stage also gives a five-star review, with Mark Shenton describing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - co-devised by Rowling, with director John Tiffany and playwright Jack Thorne - as a ""truly game-changing production and a thrilling theatrical endeavour"".
It is an ""entirely original"" piece of work, with ""Dickensian sweep and momentum to the storytelling"", writes Shenton, adding: ""It earns its place on the stage, feeling distinct from both the books and the screen adaptations.
""By turns playful and gripping, disturbing and detailed, poignant and powerful, it is superb family entertainment.""
Shenton also praises ""the theatrical wizards who've created this stunningly-realised alternative universe deliver one coup de theatre after another"".
In a nod to the Kings Cross platform number, Ann Treneman gives the play four and three-quarters stars in The Times, saying the ""wizardry on display"" is ""out of this world"".
She says the plot is complex (""there are mazes that are more straightforward"") but adds: ""It's a raunchless Game of Thrones with heart. Crucially, it's authentic Potter but, most importantly, it's new.
""It's not the movie of the book. It's the real deal, live in front of you, so much better than any film could be.""
In The Guardian, Michael Billington noted the Cursed Child will make more sense to ""hardened Potterheads"", but applauded Tiffany for directing a ""thrilling theatrical spectacle"", giving it four stars.
He praised the strong performances that meant acting was central to the story, despite the dazzling special effects, singling out Sam Clemmett as Harry's son Albus, ""wonderfully quirky"" Anthony Boyle as his friend Scorpius Malfoy, and the adult Harry (Jamie Parker), ""authoritative"" Hermione (Noma Dumezweni) and ""bluntly commonsensical"" Ron (Paul Thornley).
It's another five stars from The Independent, with Jack Shepherd describing it as ""magical"". He argues Part One should be billed as a magic show, due to the effects used, also praising its moments of comedy.
Shepherd adds: ""It's quite apparent this isn't written to be either a book or a tie-in film; it's a spectacle for the theatre, one that is filled to the brim with fan service and magical imagery that will amaze.""
Quentin Letts grumbles about the length of the play in the Daily Mail, noting: ""There were moments I could have done with a glug of gurdyroot infusion to keep me alert.""
But he admits: ""Potter addicts will love it. JK Rowling is going to make (another) fortune. The West End's ornate Palace Theatre, itself a little like Hogwarts, has a hit probably for years.""
Variety describes it as ""spellbinding"", Matt Trueman writing that it is: ""The Show That Lived Up to Expectations â€” and Then Some.""
He says the relationship between Albus and Scorpius is ""the friendship of two bullied boys bound together, and it's a beautiful, tender thing"", adding: ""The script by Jack Thorne recognizes that rejection breeds resentment, and outsiders stew into outcasts.
""No one's born a villain, nor sees themselves as such, and where the books gave us stock baddies, Cursed Child fleshes them out.""
Chris Jones, in the Chicago Tribune, says that ""heretical as this may sound"", the play left him ""quietly lamenting that the movies were ever made"".
Ben Brantley in the New York Times writes: ""Like the novels that preceded it, The Cursed Child is stuffed with arcana-filled plots that defy diagrams and baldly wrought sentimental life lessons, along with anguished dives into the earnest, tortured solipsism of adolescence.
""By rights, such a combination should try the patience of any grown-up. But like Ms Rowling's books, the play vanquishes resistance.""
The Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since 1997 and been adapted into eight films.
The script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is published this weekend.

270,"There were celebrations in Europe after Germany surrendered.
But on the other side of the world in the Pacific Ocean, Japan was still fighting against America, Britain and their allies.
The Americans, however, had a secret plan to end the war - by using the most powerful weapon ever created.
On 6 August 1945, at 8.15am Japanese time, an American B-29 bomber plane, called 'Enola Gay', dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.
The devastation was beyond anything seen before. The city was immediately flattened.
80,000 people were killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 were injured.
Even then, Japan didn't surrender.
Three days later, another nuclear bomb was dropped by the Americans on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.
Shortly afterwards, on 15 August 1945, Japan finally admitted defeat.
World War Two was over.
When the bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the city has struck by a flash of blinding light then a giant cloud shaped like a mushroom.
The blast flattened buildings within a 2.5 km radius of the bomb.
There were 90,000 buildings in Hiroshima before the bomb was dropped but only 28,000 remained after the explosion.
Thousands and thousands of people were killed.  Many were badly injured.
But the suffering didn't end there because it wasn't just a normal bomb.
The nuclear radiation released when it exploded caused people to suffer horrible illnesses.
Thousands more people died from their injuries and radiation sickness in the weeks, months and years that followed.
Japan was at war with America and its allies, which included Britain and Soviet Union (a nation made up of modern-day Russia and other countries).
The allies were winning the war and the Japanese forces had been pushed back from many locations.
However fighting was still very fierce and soldiers and civilians were dying every day.
Japan had been at war for many years.
It had invaded the countries near to it such as China and the Japanese had attacked America.
Everywhere the Japanese soldiers went, they were known for their cruelty.
They treated prisoners of war very badly, including  American and British soldiers who had surrendered.
US President Harry S Truman wanted the Japanese to surrender as quickly as possible so he could save lives.
The atomic bomb was a deadly new weapon.
President Truman hoped the massive destruction it caused would shock the Japanese into realising they had to surrender.
US President Truman wanted to avoid a land invasion of Japan.
There were 2.5 million Japanese troops stationed there and Truman's staff estimated that defeating them would cost the lives of 250,000 US soldiers.
Some historians also say that the US wanted to avoid Japan being occupied by Soviet troops.
America and the Soviet Union were allies but they did not really trust each other.
It was the first and only time that atomic bombs have been used in a war.
Although the scientists who made the bombs were proud of what they'd achieved, it scared them as well.
The way the atomic bomb was built meant it had huge power - enough to destroy whole cities on it's own.
Many people now believe that the devastation caused in Hiroshima, and in Nagasaki, was so awful that the bombs should never be used again.
Today, a small number of countries around the world, including USA, China and the UK, have nuclear weapons.
Some campaigners argue that there is no place for nuclear weapons and that all countries should get rid of them immediately.
Others say that having such terrible weapons will keep a country safe, even if they are never used.","In 1945, World War Two - the biggest war the world had ever seen - was coming to an end."
271,"Alistair Fitt, vice chancellor of Oxford Brookes, was giving evidence to the Education Select Committee, holding a special away-day session at the University of Oxford.
With the elegant panorama of Pembroke College behind them, the MPs wanted to find out what would be the impact of Brexit on the UK's university sector.
You would be hard-pressed to find any sector in the country more opposed to Brexit than higher education.
So it was probably no surprise that the MPs heard an unrelenting message that leaving the EU was a grim prospect for higher education and research.
University organisations, which usually put much effort and ingenuity into not really being for or against anything in public, took to open campaigning for a Remain vote.
Universities, bastions of liberal thinking, intensely international in their outlook and staffing, seemed culturally allergic to Brexit.
And the referendum result hangs over them like they've fought and lost a civil war.
Professor Catherine Barnard from the University of Cambridge told MPs that her own university had seen a 14% drop in applications this year from EU students.
The university had asked why potential students had turned down a chance to study at Cambridge - and she said among the reasons were fears over an ""anti-immigrant sentiment"" and uncertainty over the future of the UK's involvement in international research.
Prof Barnard warned that talented mathematicians at Cambridge from countries such as Hungary, Poland and Romania would take their sought-after skills elsewhere.
The committee of MPs heard warnings that in some elite research institutions in the UK, vital to the national infrastructure, as many as two thirds of the staff were EU nationals from outside the UK.
Would they hang around and see if they were still wanted after Brexit? Or would research rivals in Germany or China snap them up to the detriment of the UK economy?
Showing how seriously they take this, Oxford University has appointed its own head of Brexit strategy.
So you could say that at least Brexit has already created one extra job.
But this new postholder, Professor Alistair Buchan, saw leaving the EU as threatening to relegate the UK's universities behind their global competition.
Oxford has been ranked as the world's top university, but Prof Buchan said that in 1970s the UK's universities did not have that top status. This had been built through the EU years and growing networks of international partnerships.
He described Brexit for universities as the ""Manchester United problem"".
Why would any football team with international ambitions deliberately want to restrict its access both to better talent and to bigger markets?
There were warnings about the financial impact of losing European research funding.
The UK's universities are among the biggest winners from Horizon 2020 research network, bringing more than Â£2bn into the higher education sector.
This is no small-biÃ¨re, with some individual universities worrying about the loss of hundreds of millions.
If the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some ""serious funding"".
Professor Stephanie Haywood, president of the Engineering Professors' Council, warned that losing access to EU students would make skills shortages in engineering even worse.
But could there be an upside in higher tuition fees?
If EU students are designated as overseas students after Brexit, UK universities could charge them much higher fees.
But such a tuition fee windfall depends on those students not staying at home or going somewhere else.
Prof Barnard raised the example of those talented eastern European mathematicians.
Would they really be able to pay Â£17,000 or so a year? Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere?
Committee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts.
But what came back most often was even more questions. What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will be the visa system for students?
What will happen to the intricate networks of European research? How much will the UK government be willing to cover for any lost income?
And of course, so far, these are unknowns being piled up on unknowables.
But as another European refugee scientist, Albert Einstein, once said: ""If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research.""","A ""hard Brexit"" would be the ""biggest disaster"" to have hit the UK's universities for many years, a university head told MPs."
272,"Six men and two women were killed when the minibus they were in collided with two lorries near Milton Keynes.
Ryszard Masierak, 31, and David Wagstaff, 53, have been charged with eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving.
The first victim has been identified as minibus owner Cyriac Joseph, 52.
Wipro, an IT services company, said three of its employees were also among those who died, and a fourth staff member had been critically injured.
""It is with deep regret and sadness that we confirm the passing away of three of our colleagues, Karthikeyan Ramasubramaniyam Pugalur, Rishi Rajeev Kumar, and Vivek Bhaskaran in a tragic road accident in the UK,"" a spokesman for the firm said.

It is understood the men were all contracted to work in Nottingham.
A service was held in memory of Mr Joseph on Sunday at St Paul's Church, Lenton, Nottingham.
Father Biju Joseph, who conducted the Mass, confirmed Mr Joseph's wife and children, a 19-year-old man and girl aged 15, who attended the service, were told of his death by police on Saturday morning.
He said the prayer service was a ""great relief"" for them.
""It's so sad and we're praying to God for his soul and his family,"" he said. ""People are really shocked, he was such a good friend. He was like a brother to me.""
Alex Daniel, a friend, said Mr Joseph was a ""great leader"" within the south Indian community in Nottingham.
He said: ""I'm not surprised by the amount of people who came here [to the service]. We got calls from across the country showing concerns for the family.""
A five-year-old girl, a man and a woman were left with life-threatening injuries in the crash, and are still critically ill in hospital. Another woman has serious injuries.
Thames Valley Police said the vehicles were all travelling in the same direction southbound between junctions 15 and 14 at Newport Pagnell at about 03:15 BST on Saturday.
Some of those on board the minibus, which carried branding for the Nottingham-based firm ABC Travels, were visiting the UK from India, police said.
Friends of Mr Joseph, who was also known as Benny and originally came from the Indian state of Kerala, paid tribute on social media.
""My dearest friend Benny passed away this morning after a huge road accident happened in M1 in London,"" said Soyimon Joseph in a Facebook post.
""Hearty condolences. I never thought yesterday 10pm you say thank you to me it was our last meeting.""

273,"The UK is holding its breath, waiting for the results in the coming weeks of the long-delayed Chilcot enquiry into those events.
It is also agonising over whether to join the Americans and others in extending its bombing campaign  from Iraq to Syria against the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), whose rise is widely seen as a consequence of the 2003 invasion and the ensuing upheavals.
Since the outset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Americans and their Western partners have been mesmerised by the chaos in Iraq as an object lesson for how not to deal with Syria.
That is the overriding reason why they have long tiptoed around the prospect of embroilment in the Syrian affair.
US President Barack Obama was elected specifically on a platform of ending such foreign adventures, not getting caught in yet another one.
It was only with extreme reluctance that he found himself drawn into the air campaigns against IS in both Iraq and Syria, with limited and cautious engagement of advisers and special forces on the ground.
It was all very different back in 2002 and 2003, when the neo-conservatives then in the ascendant in Washington were looking for any pretext to move against Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein, as part of a broader ambition to shape a ""new Middle East"".
Ahmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, at that time headed the umbrella opposition grouping in exile called the Iraqi National Council (INC).
Viscerally dedicated to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Chalabi found himself point man for an opposition effort to persuade the Americans to invade and rid the country of the feared dictator, having despaired of other methods such as trying to engineer an internal coup.
He found himself knocking on an open door.
If he knowingly misled Washington with dodgy intelligence on Saddam's non-existent weapons of mass destruction and links with international terrorism, he knew that powerful American circles were willingly taking the bait without scrutiny as they prepared for their war of choice.
They were using him, and he was using them.
With the Chilcot conclusions looming, Tony Blair, who led the UK into the Iraq war alongside the Americans, came out recently in a CNN interview with a qualified apology for the fact that the intelligence on which the invasion was based was false and that insufficient thought had been given to what should happen next.
But Chalabi entertained no such misgivings. In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.
But it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.
In the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.
Thousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.
IS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.
Now it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.
That is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.
Doing nothing may increasingly not be an option. But the fate of Iraq since 2003 underscores the potentially disastrous dangers of ill-conceived meddling.","The unexpected death of Ahmed Chalabi has highlighted the burning issues still haunting the UK and the West, long after the key role he played in manipulating the US-led invasion and overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003."

275,"""It would be a fundamental forward step for Wales,"" said South and Mid Wales Chambers of Commerce president Liz Maher.
Meanwhile, a business confidence plan and a £5m jobs and growth fund have been announced by First Minister Carwyn Jones, as a response to Brexit.
He hosted an extraordinary meeting of the Council for Economic Renewal.
It brought together business leaders, the TUC and senior politicians to discuss the impact of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
It was set-up in response to the financial crisis and meets around three times a year.
This was thought to be its first extraordinary meeting.
Prime Minister Theresa May has already met with Mr Jones and says Wales and the other devolved nations will have a role to play in negotiations.
The first minister said the Welsh Government wanted to assure businesses and inward investors that Wales remains open for business.
""The EU referendum result has created uncertainty and instability which can damage business confidence and have a longer-term impact on jobs and investment,"" he said.
Mr Jones is allocating £5m to the new Growth and Prosperity Fund to ensure the economy continued to grow and Wales continued to be an attractive destination for investment.
""These actions will support Welsh businesses looking to grow and increase the number and scale of Welsh-based companies that are exporting,"" he said.
""We will also be engaging with businesses about how we can support them and promoting Wales with potential inward investors.""
Ms Maher said EU funding and the labour skills gap, which would influence future immigration policy, were some of the issues which needed answering in Wales.
""There's such a long way to go but there are opportunities there,"" said Ms Maher.
She said as well as stability for the economy there needed to be action and the taskforce would bring together the ""huge amount of experience"" and specialist knowledge from business.
The business confidence plan - outlined by Economy and Infrastructure Secretary Ken Skates - includes discussing what support Finance Wales could bring and also bringing forward a plan for export support.
The Welsh Government is also planning an all-age apprenticeship programme and a campaign to support tourist businesses.
Details on how to apply to the Growth and Prosperity Fund will be available shortly.
The leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies called for a ""spirit of conciliation"".
He said: ""Today's calls for a taskforce to deal with Brexit are sensible, but the first minister needs to reach out to people from both sides of the referendum campaign.
""Brexit presents Wales with significant opportunities and poses questions that could be best answered by a diverse range of voices - not just a chorus of politicians who opposed leaving the EU.""",Business leaders in Wales have called for a taskforce to deal with the implications of the referendum result.

277,"US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Americans will leave RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk and RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire.
The move is part of a programme to save £320m ($500m) a year across Europe. The USAF lease the RAF bases.
Mr Hagel said he understood it would mean job losses and thanked those who had supported the US Air Force.
""I know that this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations; I value the tremendous support they provided us for decades.""
The USAF KC-135 tanker fleet based at Mildenhall will be moved to Germany.
RAF Lakenheath, with two squadrons of new F-35 jets (48 of them) arriving by 2020, will be the aircraft's only European base.
The Pentagon said the loss of about 2,000 US military and civilian personnel is due to relocation away from Mildenhall, but will be offset by the addition of about 1,200 people stationed permanently at Lakenheath.
Matthew Hancock, West Suffolk MP and Minister of State for Business, Enterprise and Energy, said he would support the community affected.
Mildenhall had a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force and the move ""will come as a shock to many"", he said.
""I have met with the defence secretary, and others in government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community.
""We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs [local enterprise partnerships], councils, the Ministry of Defence and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area.""
A UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The US Department of Defence (DoD) has been reviewing its requirement for bases across Europe as part of (its) European infrastructure consolidation review.""
RAF Mildenhall is used as a transport hub by the USAF and is home to air refuelling tankers and special operations forces.
It has about 3,200 military personnel, with 400-500 UK civilian staff employed there.
Both bases are in the Forest Heath District Council area.
James Waters, leader of the council, said: ""The USAF contributes significantly to the local economy so the expansion of RAF Lakenheath, and with it the US government's commitment to the site as part of its long term plans, is very welcome.
""But this happiness is obviously tempered by our sadness that Mildenhall is to close.
""Both announcements mean huge changes to the landscape of Forest Heath , but I am optimistic that with every change there are opportunities for reinvention, growth and investment.""
For some years now the US military has been reviewing its bases in Europe, eager to reduce its footprint to rationalise and cut costs.
In part it is due to budget constraints but it is also driven by strategic changes as the Pentagon turns its gaze increasingly towards the Asia-Pacific.
RAF Mildenhall has been an important base for the Americans since the early 1950s when it was home to strategic bombers.
Currently it houses US Air Force Special Forces and a fleet of air-to-air tankers.
The latter, though less glamorous than fast jets, are some of the most important elements of the USAF, described by one analyst as the ""kryptonite"" of modern air power.
They enable combat and support aircraft to reach their targets and to remain over combat zones for the time needed to carry out their missions.
It is likely that the KC-135 tankers from Mildenhall will move to a US base in Germany.
British defence sources are eager to stress that the base closures here - two US-run communications stations at RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire are also to shut down  - do not represent any dilution of Washington's commitment to European security.
Indeed RAF Lakenheath is due to host two squadrons of new F-35 aircraft when they enter service.
Over recent months the Americans have deployed small but significant reinforcements to Europe to reassure NATO allies like Poland and the Baltic republics in the wake of Russia's actions against Ukraine.
The US had hundreds of tanks in Europe during Cold War but there was a brief moment after 2013 when all US tanks had been withdrawn from Europe.
Today about a battalion's worth are back in Europe exercising with allies.
But the Pentagon has plans to store an armoured brigade's worth of equipment - some 150 tanks along with other armoured vehicles  - in Europe by 2015.
RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth are used as USAF communications bases, rather than for flying, and their operations were expected to move to RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.
The USAF has about 750 military personnel at the two Cambridgeshire bases, with a further 1,500 civilian employees and dependents.
Jason Ablewhite, leader of Huntingdonshire District Council, said the news was ""hugely disappointing"" as both bases contributed about £40m a year to the local economy.
He said it would mean the loss of 760 personnel and 1,500 civilian jobs, adding: ""The impact on the local economy could be considerable.
""However, the Enterprise Zone is on the same site as RAF Alconbury, and will provide thousands of jobs over the coming years.""",The United States Air Force (USAF) has confirmed it will pull out of three UK airbases.
278,"Ms Borst, 81, helped push through legislation in 2001 that made the Netherlands the first country to legalise euthanasia.
Forensic scientists were unable to say why she died. Police have said it was either an accident or a crime.
Ms Borst, who was a medical academic, served as minister from 1994-2002.
Her body was found on Monday evening and the area around her home near the central city of Utrecht was cordoned off.
Initial inquiries proved inconclusive, however police on Tuesday ruled out death by natural causes.
A full post mortem examination will now take place at the Netherlands Forensic Institute, they say.
""She may have had an accident after she felt unwell, but that cannot yet be said with certainty,"" a police spokesman told Dutch media. ""So we cannot yet say whether any crime may have been involved.""
A spokesman had earlier told Dutch radio there were no indications of anything untoward happening.
Els Borst had appeared at a conference of her liberal D66 party on Saturday and her death came as a shock to political colleagues in The Hague.
For a time, she led her party in the 1990s and Prime Minister Mark Rutte said her death was a great loss for Dutch politics.
""She ensured a breakthrough in the field of euthanasia for which very many people are still grateful,"" said Health Minister Edith Schippers.
She was also behind legislation governing the use of tissue from aborted foetuses for medical research.","Dutch authorities have begun an investigation into the death of former health minister Els Borst, whose body was found in her garage by a friend."

Under previous administrations, the director and joint chiefs attended all meetings of the NSC's inner circle, the principals' committee.
The National Security Council (NSC) is the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs.
It is led by retired lieutenant-general Mike Flynn, who was one of Mr Trump's closest advisers and most ardent supporters during the campaign.
""The security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries,"" Mr Trump's executive order said.
""Accordingly, the United States Government's decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative.""
Last week, Mr Bannon described the US mainstream media as ""the opposition party"", saying it should ""keep its mouth shut"".
The site he once managed, Breitbart News, serves up an anti-establishment agenda that critics accuse of xenophobia and misogyny. Under Mr Bannon, it became one of the most-read conservative news and opinion sites in the US.

But struggling to meet costs, Ms Boyko raised ??3,500 online and called her ""the people's cow"".
Now Cornish accountant Martin Sands, who saw the news story, has agreed to pay ??65 a month for ongoing keep.
Mr Sands said it was ""not a normal thing"" for him to sponsor a cow as he did not have a particular interest in animals.
But he said Jean Jeanie was ""a really beautiful cow"" and he was overwhelmed by her story.
""Some of her sponsors had promised income for 12 months and then dropped out, so I promised to fund her for 12 months - probably longer.""
The cow was spotted alone in a field by Ms Boyko who, after hearing she might be destined for market, purchased the animal.
The 52-year-old made a Facebook page for Jean, short for the cow's registered name of Mooridge Jeanie, which attracted donations.
""She lit my days up and I'd like to think I cheered her up. She's got a lovely character, she's really gentle, she's lovely.

289,"His was not the only voice warning of the dangers of AI - Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak also expressed their concerns about where the technology was heading - though Professor Hawking's was the most apocalyptic vision of a world where robots decide they don't need us any more.
What all of these prophets of AI doom wanted to do was to get the world thinking about where the science was heading - and make sure other voices joined the scientists in that debate.
That they have achieved that aim was evident on Wednesday night at an event in Cambridge marking the opening of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, designed to do some of that thinking about the implications of AI.
And Professor Hawking was there to help launch the centre. ""I'm glad someone was listening,"" he told the audience.
In a short speech, he outlined the potential and the pitfalls of the technology in his usual vivid language.  He reviewed the recent rapid progress in areas like self-driving cars and the triumph of Google's DeepMind in the game of Go - and predicted further advances.
""I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.  It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence â€” and exceed it.""
That, he said, could lead to the eradication of disease and poverty and the conquest of climate change. But it could also bring us all sorts of things we didn't like - autonomous weapons, economic disruption  and machines that developed a will of their own, in conflict with humanity.
""In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.  We do not yet know which.""
So, an easy enough mission for the Centre for the Study of Intelligence - just find out whether AI is going to kill us or not.
Actually the multi-disciplinary centre,  which brings together philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists,  will have a rather more practical programme of research.
Long before the robots decide whether we are surplus to requirements,  we are for instance going to need to think about issues such as whether autonomous vehicles should be programmed to protect pedestrians or passengers.
Another speaker at the event was Professor Maggie Boden, a major figure in artificial intelligence research for more than 50 years.
She told me she had long seen the need for the debate we are having now - but she was not worrying about our imminent extinction and was rather less convinced than Professor Hawking that we were heading into the AI future at breakneck speed.
Her concern was about the impact of automation right now - in Japan at least - on elderly people.  She pointed to the enthusiasm for the use of robots in the care of the elderly and sick and said society would have to ask whether this was dehumanising. ""I'm scared of that,"" she said.
After decades of research into AI,  Professor Boden still does not see robots replacing humans in functions which require empathy and emotional intelligence. Artificial intelligence could soon offer governments the chance to cut growing bills for social care - but at a cost for those in need of  help.
Just one of the issues which will now be addressed by the Centre for the Future of Intelligence - and rather more urgent than the threat from some future Terminator.

His twin brother Darren said the family were ""still fighting for acknowledgement that David was let down"" by Northumbria Police.
The force said the family's legal case against it would go to court in 2016.
Family members claim Northumbria Police did not do enough to warn staff that Moat had told a 999 call handler he was hunting for officers on the night of the shooting. The force denies this.
Traffic officer PC Rathband was finishing his shift in a marked patrol car when he was shot twice by a shotgun fired by Moat.
He survived but lost his sight in both eyes.
Moat had shot Samantha Stobbart, who survived, and Chris Brown, who died, in Birtley, Gateshead, the previous day hours after his release from prison.
Following a week on the run, the former nightclub bouncer turned the gun on himself during a stand-off with police in Rothbury on 10 July.
After he was shot, PC Rathband founded the Blue Lamp Foundation to help injured 999 workers, wrote a book about his experiences and became a national figure.
However, he struggled to cope with the consequences of losing his sight and the father-of-two, 44, killed himself at his home in Blyth, Northumberland.
His brother, who lives in Australia, said of the 4 July anniversary of the shooting: ""As a family we obviously reflect on past events that had such a tragic outcome for David.
""It means we understand more than most the risks the emergency services, especially police, are asked to face on a daily basis.""
He said the dangers faced by officers from acts of terror was ""very pertinent"" following attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait.
""Sadly, David will not be the last police officer injured in the line of duty; three officers have been shot and numerous have been hurt in the UK since 2010,"" he said.

BT had been expecting such action after it launched its own case against Google in 2011.
That dispute has yet to be resolved.
""We have always seen litigation as a last resort, and we work hard to avoid lawsuits,"" said a spokeswoman for Google.
""But BT has brought several meritless patent claims against Google and our customers - and they've also been arming patent trolls.""
The term ""patent troll"" describes firms that acquire patents so that they can later extract settlements from companies on infringement claims.
In 2012, New Jersey-based intellectual property owner Suffolk Technologies sued Google and US internet service provider AOL over two patents it had acquired from BT.
In addition, Steelhead Licensing - another firm which owns patents but does not produce products of its own - has filed a case against 14 handset makers and mobile networks, including Google's Motorola unit, claiming infringement of a wireless technology which used to be owned by BT.
A spokesman for the British firm said it did not comment on pending litigation.
Google has struck back with claims that BT has infringed a method to allow PCs to use an internet-based telephone system based on a patent originally filed by Fujitsu.
And it says BT failed to license a system used to let computer servers prioritise data - an IBM invention now owned by the search firm.
Patent consultant Florian Mueller said this was the first clear case of Google suing another company over its patents.

Tries from Teimana Harrison, George North and Jamie Gibson wrestled Saints back into it, before Burns and Stephen Myler traded kicks to make it 27-27.
But Tigers, boosted by the return of Manu Tuilagi, stole it at the death.
England centre Tuilagi, who ended speculation linking him with a move away from Leicester by signing a new contract last month, had not played since October 2014 because of an ongoing groin problem.
But the 24-year-old came on for the final 29 minutes against Northampton, demonstrating his trademark physicality as Leicester eventually broke their resistance with the final kick of the game.
Richard Cockerill's side, comfortably beaten by Saracens last week, had looked to be cruising to victory when tries from Smith, McCaffrey and Williams, who was later taken off with a suspected broken jaw, put them in command after a dominant opening quarter.
But Harrison's score following a line-out catch-and-drive moments before half-time gave Saints hope, and North ran from deep inside his own half to drag them to within four points early in the second period.
Shortly after Northampton had a further try through Paul Hill ruled out for a high tackle, two Burns penalties stretched Leicester's lead back to 10 points - only for Gibson's touchdown against his former club and Myler's penalty with five minutes to go to leave the scores tied.
However, Burns, who had already missed one drop-goal attempt, split the posts from the tee to send Tigers up to fourth in the table, seven points above their fifth-placed local rivals.
Leicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill:
""Credit to them for getting back into it, but credit to our players for the first 30 minutes and then for digging themselves out of a hole they probably shouldn't have got themselves into.
""Good sides win when they do some average things, and we did some average things today but we found a way to win, however fortuitous that may or may not have been.""
Northampton Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder:
""My reaction is clearly one of disappointment. I spoke to Courtney Lawes afterwards, and he said he tripped (in the incident that led to the last-minute penalty being awarded).
""In the first half, we had a terrible 20 minutes - they were good, but we were terrible for 20 minutes - and you should not go 21-0 down at Welford Road.""

296,"Watson, who climbs to a career-high 38th in the world rankings, is the first British woman since Anne Hobbs in 1985 to win a second tour title.
The 22-year-old from Guernsey did not drop a set throughout the week.
She now heads to the Australian Open, where she will play Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova in round one on Tuesday.
Watson won her first WTA title in Osaka two years ago, before her career was interrupted by illness.
She began last year ranked 119th in the world following a bout of glandular fever but has since recovered and begun working with Argentine coach Diego Veronelli.
Victory in Hobart means Watson moved 11 places up the world rankings.
""Thanks to my coach Diego. It's been great working with you,"" she said afterwards.
""We work really hard but we also have fun.""
Brengle, the world number 84, was a surprise finalist having come through qualifying, but the 24-year-old made the early running in the final.
After a rain-interrupted semi-final there was another early shower on Saturday, and Watson then survived a 14-minute opening service game that included six break points.
The service struggles continued in the wind and Watson twice fell a break behind but was able to hit back immediately each time, levelling at 3-3 after a scrappy 44 minutes.
Watson then made the decisive move as she reeled off three games to take the set, and after a steadier start to the second she went ahead again at 4-3.
There was a hint of nerves when she slipped 15-30 behind while serving for the match, but Watson closed out the win and headed to the stands to hug coach Veronelli.
""When I won Osaka in 2012, it was more of a surprise,"" said Watson. ""But here, I feel like I belong.
""I'm obviously very happy. It was tough conditions again today, very windy, and I knew Madison would be tough - we know each other very well on and off the court, and we practise a lot in Florida.
""It really was my toughest match of the week. I was happy I stayed mentally strong and managed to get ahead and hold my nerve at the end.""",British number one Heather Watson beat American qualifier Madison Brengle in straight sets to win her second WTA title at the Hobart International.
297,"More than 7,000 children and adolescents had their mental health referrals rejected last year.
The Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH) described the figure as ""astonishing"".
The Scottish government has already said it will commission a review into rejected referrals.
But SAMH said the issue needed to be addressed as quickly as possible because young people were ""waiting now to get help and support"".
The charity's Jo Anderson said 17,500 people had been turned away from receiving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) support over the past three years.
She added: ""That's an astonishing figure, and we don't know what happens to them after they've been turned away. We don't know whether they received any other support.
""In the last few weeks of the campaign we've been running, we've been inundated with calls from parents who're in that situation and their child has been rejected from receiving a CAMHS service.
""They haven't been signposted anywhere else - that's a very worrying picture.""
Caitlin Wyllie-Quinn, 20, a student from Irvine, had a difficult transition to secondary school.
Bullying left her isolated and very down, crying all the time.
She got some initial help from the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service but after leaving therapy she went downhill rapidly.
Her GP made another referral to CAMHS but this time it was rejected. Caitlin was told that because she was not suicidal or self-harming, her case was not serious enough.
""If the person doing the assessment had asked me if I was suicidal or self-harming I would have answered yes to both those questions, but basically I was refused help because they didn't have the capability to assess me properly,"" she said.
""I was at a real low point and I felt that getting referred to CAMHS was some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and finally maybe getting some help.
""For that to be stripped away from me made me feel even more worthless and just made things so much worse for me.""
The NHS in Scotland provides mental health services for children and young people with a wide range of mental health problems including anxiety, behaviour problems, depression and early onset psychosis.
The Scottish government's mental health strategy commits it to carrying out reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals.
Its mental health minister, Maureen Watt, said the reviews would happen ""soon"", and would allow improvements to be made to the system.
Ms Anderson said this was encouraging, but added: ""We really urge that to be quick and thorough because there are young people waiting now to get help and support.
""It might be that the CAMHS service isn't appropriate for them, but we simply don't know what the problem is.""
Meanwhile, statistics published on Tuesday also showed that a waiting time target for people to receive specialist mental health treatment has again been missed.
The Scottish government has had a target in place since 2014 for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks of referral for mental health support.
But the target has never been met nationally - with the latest figures showing that 83.6% of children and adolescents, and 73.7% of adults, were seen within the required timescale between January and March of this year.
At the end of March, there were 6,932 children and young people across Scotland waiting for help from CAMHS, up from 6,359 at the end of December, according to the NHS statistics.
At the same time, there were 20,952 adults waiting for treatment, compared to 20,195 in December.
Average waiting times varied dramatically across the country, with 10 NHS boards meeting the target for CAMHS treatment but only three health boards meeting it for adult psychological care.
The figures also showed that 74 children and young people starting their treatment had been waiting more than a year to be seen.
NHS Grampian met the waiting time target for just 45.2% of young people, while in NHS Lothian the target was met for 47.8% of youngsters
And in the NHS Forth Valley area, only 40% of adults starting psychological treatment between January and March were seen within 18 weeks, with an average wait of 25 weeks.
A spokesman for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition (SCSC) said research has suggested 10% of children aged between five and 16 have a clinically diagnosable mental health problem.
Pointing to a ""clear postcode lottery"" when it comes to treatment, he added: ""We are deeply concerned about what is happening to the more than a fifth of children and young people not accepted for treatment.
""There is a need for an urgent inquiry to ascertain why these young people are being rejected for treatment and what is happening to them.""
Ms Watt, the mental health minster, said the number of health boards which had met the waiting time target for young people had increased from seven to 10 since the end of 2016.
She added: ""However, I'm clear that we must continue to reduce waiting times and I will not be satisfied until our target is met sustainably.
""Our recently published 10-year strategy for mental health sets out a range of measures that focus on prevention and early intervention to meet the mental health needs of children and young people, backed by Â£150m of funding.
""We will also soon commission reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals, as a foundation for making further improvements.""",Mental health campaigners have called for an urgent review into why so many young people in Scotland are being turned down for specialist treatment.
298,"Kromtech - the Germany-based firm behind MacKeeper - has acknowledged that its customers' names, internet addresses and login credentials were among the data  exposed.
However, it said that users' payment details were ""never at risk"".
The firm believes the details were accessed only by the security expert who alerted it to the problem.
""The privacy and security of our clients' information remains our top priority and from the moment we were aware of the access, we immediately took several proactive steps to identify and correct the issue,"" it said in a statement.
""We want to offer a special 'thank you' to security researcher Chris Vickery for identifying the security breach attempt so that we could stop it before anyone was harmed.""
Mr Vickery told security blogger Brian Krebs that he had discovered 21 gigabytes of MacKeeper user data ""after spending a few bored moments searching for database servers"" that were not password-protected. He was able to do this by using Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices.
Mr Krebs reported that Kromtech initially said that 13 million customers' details had been exposed.
That figure was removed from the firm's statement - a spokesman for Kromtech told the BBC it had included both ""active and non-active"" users.
MacKeeper is widely promoted on the web - including in prominent adverts on Ookla's Speedtest site - as a way to ""clean"" and ""protect"" Macintosh computers in order to help them run faster.
However, critics have claimed that the software can cause computers to slow down and crash, and can be problematic to remove.

The former Wham! star said the channel had been ""insensitive, contemptuous and reprehensible"" and should have waited until after his friend's funeral.
But Channel 5 said it was ""a measured account"" of Michael's life and death.
""George Michael was a high-profile public figure and there has been legitimate public interest in the circumstances surrounding his death,"" the broadcaster said in a statement.
It said the documentary, which aired at 21:00 GMT on Thursday, had been ""based on contributions from those who knew him and reported on him over many decades"".
Ridgeley, who paid an emotional tribute to Michael at last month's Brit Awards, had called the programme a ""piece of voyeurism"" that should only have been aired ""after a respectful period"".
It was confirmed earlier this month that Michael - who was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou - died on Christmas Day as a result of heart and liver disease.

She added: ""We have therefore suspended Councillor Frost from the Conservative Group pending investigation.""

303,"Current drugs help manage the symptoms, but do not prevent brain cells dying.
The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.
The University College London (UCL) team is ""excited"", but it urges caution as any long-term benefit is uncertain and the drug needs more testing.
""There's absolutely no doubt the most important unmet need in Parkinson's is a drug to slow down disease progression, it's unarguable,"" Prof Tom Foltynie, one of the researchers, told the BBC.
In Parkinson's, the brain is progressively damaged and the cells that produce the hormone dopamine are lost.
It leads to a tremor, difficulty moving and eventually memory problems.
Therapies help manage symptoms by boosting dopamine levels, but the death of the brain continues and the disease gets worse.
No drug stops that happening.
In the trial, half of patients were given the diabetes drug exenatide and the rest were given a placebo (dummy treatment). All the patients stayed on their usual medication.
As expected, those on just their usual medication declined over 48 weeks of treatment. But those given exenatide were stable.
And three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off.
Prof Foltynie told the BBC News website: ""This is the first clinical trial in actual patients with Parkinson's where there has been anything like this size of effect.
""It gives us confidence exenatide is not just masking symptoms, it's doing something to the underlying disease.
""We have to be excited and encouraged, but also cautious as we need to replicate these findings.""
They also need to trial the drug for much longer periods of time.
An effective drug would need to hold back the disease for years in order to make a significant difference to patients.
Parkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was ""trivial"" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers.
The drug helps control blood sugar levels in diabetes by acting on a hormone sensor called GLP-1.
Those sensors are found in brain cells too. It is thought the drug makes those cells work more efficiently or helps them to survive.
It is why the drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.
David Dexter, the deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK, said: ""The findings offer hope that drugs like exenatide can slow the course of Parkinson's - â€Šsomething no current treatment can do.
""Because Parkinson's can progress quite gradually, this study was probably too small and short to tell us whether exenatide can halt the progression of the condition, but it's certainly encouraging and warrants further investigation.""
Dr Brian Fiske, from the The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, said: ""The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.""","It may be possible to stop the progression of Parkinson's disease with a drug normally used in type 2 diabetes, a clinical trial suggests."

She said: ""The very first person I come to is a horrible racist. I'm never coming back to wherever this is.""
She later said the comments were ""inappropriate"" but UKIP said it showed ""contempt"" for people's concerns.
Updates on this story and more from Derbyshire
The man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as ""spongers"", but denied being racist.
The North West Durham MP said: ""The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them.
""Concerns about immigration are entirely valid and it's important that politicians engage with them.
""I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.""
But those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU criticised her remarks.
Conservative MP Peter Bone, one of the founders of Grassroots Out, said: ""It is disappointing that a member of the Remain campaign called a voter a 'horrible racist' for raising perfectly valid concerns about the impact uncontrolled migration is having on the UK.""
And Steven Woolfe MEP, UKIP's migration spokesman, said her comments showed ""the contempt Labour has for ordinary workers' concerns"".
""It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. We have had Gordon Brown calling a Labour supporter a bigot, Emily Thornberry ridiculing a white van man displaying an English flag - and now this.""
Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as ""shocking"". ""A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration.
""Pat Glass's comments do not reflect the views of a large number of Labour voters.""
Conservative MP for Erewash Maggie Throup had urged Ms Glass ""to make a full apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity"" and to return to the area ""to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a family"".
In April 2010, then PM Gordon Brown apologised after being recorded describing a 65-year-old voter as a ""bigoted woman"".
Labour MP Ms Thornberry quit the shadow cabinet in 2014 after a photo she tweeted of a house with three England flags and a white van parked outside, during the Rochester by-election, was criticised as ""disrespectful"".
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, told BBC One's Question Time: ""Pat has apologised and of course it's not racist to want to leave the European Union, it's not racist to be worried about immigration - there are concerns particularly about dodgy employers who exploit low skilled migration to undercut wages and jobs and I think something should be done about that.""

305,"In the other group, qualification will go down to the final day of matches, after bottom side Al Ahly finally recorded a win - beating leaders Wydad Casablanca 1-0.
Zambia's Zesco are tied with Wydad after being held 1-1 by Asec Mimosas of Ivory Coast, who have the same number of points as Ahly.
The loss led to the resignation of Zamalek coach Mohamed Helmi, while captain Hazem Emam has been suspended over an altercation with a team member.
Zamalek chairman accepted Helmi's resignation and has appointed Mohamed Salah  as interim coach.
An own-goal from Zamalek's Ali Gabr in the 79th minute secured Sundowns' qualification to complete a remarkable turnaround for the South Africans in the Champions League.
Sundowns had been eliminated in the final qualifying round for the Champions League last April by AS Vita Club from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Demoted to the second-tier Confederation Cup, Sundowns were beaten by Medeama of Ghana in a play-off to suffer further African disappointment.
But on the eve of the June draw for the Champions League groups, the organisers kicked out Vita Club for using a banned player and Sundowns were reinstated.
The victory over Zamalek puts Sundowns top of Group B on nine points - six ahead of Zamalek in second.
We still have to do the business
""The gap is getting closer and closer between us and the north Africans,"" Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said after the win.
But he cautioned that Sundowns' hard work could come to nothing if they fail to win the title.
""There's a little bit of bragging rights in beating Zamalek, but we still have to do the business,"" he said.
Bottom side Enyimba of Nigeria are yet to register a point after two matches in this group which is reduced to three teams following Entente Setif's disqualification.
Enyimba and Zamalek play in the final round of group matches to decide which of them will join Sundowns in the last four.
In Group A, Wydad Casablanca of Morocco and Zesco United of Zambia also had the chance to secure semi-finals places if they both won their matches on Wednesday.
However, Zesco United were held to a draw away to Asec Mimosas in Abidjan to open up the group and keep ASEC's faint hopes of progressing alive.
Asec piled on the pressure on Zesco with a 75th minute strike from Nabi Kone, but the visitors responded five minutes later with an equaliser from Jackson Mwanza.
The result left Zesco level on seven points with leaders  Wydad Casablanca who were beaten at home by bottom-of-the-table Al Ahly of Egypt in the late match.
Asec are a further three points behind.
Ahly had managed just one point from their first three games but Rami Rabia's goal early in the second half in Morocco gave them a fine away win.

307,"But six years after he stepped down, the public response to news that he has now been freed from detention has been remarkably quiet.
Earlier this month, a top appeals court cleared Mubarak of involvement in killing some of the 900 protesters who died during the country's uprising.
Egypt's prosecutor ruled there was no reason to hold him, as he had already served a three-year sentence for embezzling public funds.
After the first legal decision, the ex-president gave a rare telephone interview to an Egyptian journalist, who offered her congratulations.
He told her that, at the age of 88, he was ""in good health"" and would be ""staying at home"" in his family's property in Heliopolis, eastern Cairo.
A former general, Mubarak was one of the Arab world's most well known leaders.  A close ally of the United States, he long kept an iron grip on power, despite claims of corruption and cronyism.
Recently, as Egypt has gone through waves of political and economic upheaval, many have come to look back at the Mubarak era as a time of relative calm and prosperity.
Karim Hussein set up a Facebook page called ""We're Sorry Mr President,"" which has more than 1.8m likes.
""It was my greatest wish in life to see President Mubarak finish with his legal case,"" says Mr Hussein, who visited the former leader in the military hospital where he spent most of his time in custody.
""I knew he was innocent from day one, because a man who once fought for the freedom of this country, would never kill its youth,"" he goes on.
""We won in the end.  It's a great victory for a great man.""
The first elected successor to President Mubarak was an Islamist, Mohammed Morsi, who was then overthrown in mass protests.
Seeking stability, Egyptians next voted in Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, another military strongman, who has led a crackdown on Islamists and pro-democracy activists.
Tens of thousands of people have been detained.
""I think we've gone a complete cycle around,"" says journalist, Shahira Amin, who rose to prominence when she resigned from state TV over its coverage of the 2011 uprising.
She has since been tried and acquitted of charges of posing a threat to national security.
Ms Amin is unsurprised by Mubarak's release or the muted reaction to it.
""Most Egyptians are just busy trying to make ends meet with the economic pressures: soaring prices, inflation, unemployment,"" Ms Amin says.
""The activists who started this revolution, many of them are behind bars.  People have been silenced or intimidated and there are no more outspoken critics of the government. ""
For those who made sacrifices in Tahrir Square, the crucible of Egypt's popular revolt, the fact that Mubarak is now free, while so many protesters remain in jail, is hard to bear.
It raises questions about whether any of their calls for reforms and freedom were ever really answered.
""His release is a sign of the corruption in the country,"" comments Randa Sami, who worked as a nurse at a field hospital in 2011.
She has life-long injuries and can only walk with crutches after police beat her.
""I put up a Facebook post saying: ""Oh God where are my rights, the rights of those killed and injured?"" Many people sympathised,"" she says.
However, she insists she has no regrets.
""It was worth it to go to the streets,"" she reflects.  ""Ok, Mubarak was not fully punished for his deeds but he was the first president to go to jail.""
""At least we got him to go through this.""","In 2011, millions of Egyptians took to the streets demanding the removal of their autocratic president of 30 years, Hosni Mubarak."

The dispute is over plans to move staff from a final salary pension scheme.
Both unions voted last month to take industrial action at Diageo sites in Scotland, as well as other locations in Northern Ireland and Cheshire.
A deal appeared to have been struck following further talks with the company.
Members of the GMB union, which has 1,200 members working with Diageo in Scotland, voted by almost 3-1 in favour of accepting the deal.
But Unite members rejected it by a margin of 62% to 38%.
Diageo, which is the world's largest producer of Scotch whisky, said it awaited confirmation from Unite of its position.
Unite, which has more than 700 members at Diageo sites around the UK, has yet to comment on the the outcome of its ballot.
However, it is understood union officials will be speaking to Unite representatives at Diageo in the coming days.

311,"The Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS), which covers the North East, Cumbria and North Yorkshire, started the scheme in January 2015.
Since then, medics have performed 60 transfusions,  a third of which were deemed to have been of critical importance to survival.
Many others have had their outcomes improved by having the intervention.
Dr Rachel Hawes, who is also a doctor on the air ambulance, used her experiences as officer in the Army Reserve - including deployment in Afghanistan - as the basis for the idea for the scheme.
She said: ""About half of people with traumatic injuries who die, die from bleeding.
""Previously, stopping the bleeding could only be done in hospital, but one of the ways to buy yourself time is to replace the blood they're losing.""

312,"After Brexit, that would obviously exclude London where the vast majority is currently done.
That has always been a major grievance for other European capitals who sense an opportunity to restart an old fight for a big prize.
London's financial district - or ""The City"" - is like a coral reef. It has grown into a complex ecosystem over hundreds of years with lots of specialist organisms feeding off each other.
The coral is home to plants and anemones which in turn are home to fish, and crustacea of dazzling variety.
Bankers and traders may be the apex predators but there are lawyers, accountants, insurance brokers and tech workers swimming around them.
It's very hard to replicate but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. If you chip a bit off - you lose a few of the resident clownfish too.
That rather extended metaphor is perhaps one way to think about the subject of euro clearing. It's a very basic, boring and yet incredibly important bit of the reef.
Clearing is the process by which a third party organisation acts as an intermediary for both buyer and seller.
They deal with the clearing ""house"" rather than each other which centralises everything and makes the whole complex business easier and quicker. 75% of all everything bought and sold in euros - anywhere in the world - is cleared in London - some 850 billion euros EVERY DAY.
Clearing houses also bear the risks that once side of the transaction doesn't cough up.
In return for that risk, buyers and sellers have to keep money in a special account with the clearing house in case there are problems. The more business you do with them, the less money proportionately of your trading volumes you need to keep in that account. Bigger clearing houses are therefore cheaper for their customers.
If you start chipping bits off the reef and carting them off to Europe those costs could rise. Some estimates put the cost of fragmenting this bit of the reef at an additional 77bn euros to the people that use them.
It would cost UK jobs too. An Ernst and Young study last year estimated that over 80,000 UK jobs would go if euro-clearing moved from London.
Other financial centres have tried for years to steal this business. In fact, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt tried to insist that all euro trades in the EU were done inside the eurozone. A policy it had to scrap when the European Court of Justice ruled in 2015 it discriminated against non-eurozone countries who are part of the EU.
If that court case is run again once the UK is outside the EU, that defence no longer works.
This new raiding party is led by the EU Financial Services Commissioner Valdis Dombrovkis who is arguing that either the EU has greater policing powers over clearing in London (a cup of cold sick in political and regulatory terms) or, the business has to relocate to the EU (two cups).
It's not clear, however, that a defeat for London would be a victory for the EU. Some euro clearing also happens in the US and many think that the way firms will minimise the cost of disruption and fragmentation will be to do their business in New York - another big reef - which would only serve to weaken Europe as a whole in the global financial power league.
That is what Chancellor Philip Hammond was getting at when he warned that the UK and Europe ""should be careful of any proposals which might disrupt growth, raise the cost of investment in Europe and the UK or weaken financial stability"".

Ofsted found no children ""inadequately protected or at risk of significant harm"" and praised ""rapid improvements"".
Service director Sue Westcott said there was ""no room for complacency"".
The Conservative-led council had been subject to an Ofsted ""notice to improve"" since June 2010, following an inspection in March of that year.
A re-inspection of children's services in August 2011 again found the overall effectiveness of the department to be inadequate.
The review of the Tyler Whelan case, published in May last year, found it was one of many agencies that missed ""numerous opportunities"" for ""more rigorous and incisive"" interventions.
Elvis Lee, 34, kicked and bit Tyler Whelan, who died in hospital after collapsing at his home in Sheepwalk, Paston, near Peterborough.
The new rating of adequate by the education standards authority means the service ""meets minimum requirements"".
It follows an eight-day unannounced inspection of the department by five Ofsted officers in January.
""They found the lessons of the past had been taken very seriously and [the council] had invested considerably in additional social workers,"" Mrs Westcott said.
Investing in more staff meant the use of agency workers had been reduced and social workers' caseloads were now ""more manageable"", she added.
Nick Sandford, leader of the Liberal Democrat group on the city council, said: ""There were some really important issues surrounding child safety but the council has recognised those significant failures and addressed them.""
He described the improvements as ""encouraging"" but questioned whether the council could maintain the required level of investment.
Earlier this week city councillors agreed ??17m worth of cuts, including to children's play centres and adult social care services.
Mrs Westcott said: ""The money that's been invested [in children's services] has been absolutely worthwhile.""
Services are rated by Ofsted as inadequate, adequate, good or outstanding.","Children's services at Peterborough City Council have been rated as adequate by Ofsted, after two consecutive years of ""poor"" ratings."

316,"The personal tale came a week after Labour MP Jon Ashworth spoke in parliament about his experience of having an alcoholic father.
The NSPCC says it receives a call every hour from an adult concerned about drug or alcohol use around children, and it believes up to a million young people could be living with an alcoholic or drug dependent parent.
So how does it feel to grow up with an addicted parent? And what impact does it have beyond childhood?
Three people shared their stories with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
Josh Connolly was nine when his father, an alcoholic, died.
Now 29, he says the experience left him full of anger, which he would often direct at other people, feeling shame at his father's behaviour but guilt for not standing by him.
""I tend to only remember a lot of the bad things and also the feelings,"" he said.
""That is what stayed with me through my life and is still tangible today; the way that my dad's drinking and everything that comes with that made me feel.""
Josh's experience led him to develop his own problems with drinking during his teenage years.
""I desperately wanted more than anything else in my life not to be an alcoholic, but when I was 12 or 13 and found alcohol, it just became the perfect escape route for me.
""I was never really able to look after my dad. At school I acted the clown, at home I am trying to be the best possible me that I could be, so alcohol gave me an escape from that.""
Jade Bailey's father was a heroin addict who took drugs around her from as far back as she could remember.
He began with cannabis and ecstasy, taking it with friends and telling his daughter it was ""medicine.""
But as she got older, he moved onto harder drugs.
""I knew it was never right and never their medicine,"" said the 25-year-old.
""I remember them going into the bathroom, I can even picture it now, and doing it, coming out and all being off their faces.
""When he went on to heroin, I was about ten years old and he was a mess. Our fun time on the weekend was going to the skip and trying to find toys.
""At that age, I thought it was amazing as my dad was always my hero.""
When Jade told her mother what had been happening when she went to visit, she stopped her from going and only let Jade contact her father by phone.
""I have never had that answer from him of why wasn't I enough to make [him] stop,"" she said. ""Why do you not love me enough to stop and be my dad?
""He knew how much I adored him and I knew he adored me, I knew I was the only thing he cared about, apart from the drug.
""It makes you feel very alone and abandoned by them, but you love them so much you can't ever leave them, no matter what they do.""
Sarah was brought up by her father, who is an alcoholic.
She said the drinking changed her relationship with him so much she had to walk away.
""In my early years, it was happy,"" she said. ""It made it harder when he turned to alcohol because I couldn't understand and it made it harder to walk away.
""I missed the old dad he was and always wished I could have the old dad back.""
Sarah never told anyone about his problem so had to deal with it alone.
She thinks the experience made her ""stronger, braver and more resilient to life's challenges"", but it affected her attitude towards alcohol.
""I always feel anxious when I am around drunk people,"" she said.
""It reminds me of the time I was looking after my dad, the feelings I got from that and the embarrassment, shame and sadness.""","Accepting a Bafta award for leading actor, Manchester by the Sea star Casey Affleck revealed to the audience he had grown up with an alcoholic parent."

The Black Cats' 10-season spell in the top flight ended when they lost 1-0 at home to Bournemouth on Saturday and Hull City drew 0-0 at Southampton.
Moyes, who took charge at Sunderland in July last year, has faced calls from supporters to step down.
""I think it's a question for two or three weeks' time,"" said the Scot.
""I think we all need to reflect and look at everything from top to bottom.""
Chairman Ellis Short, who has been trying to sell the club, apologised to Sunderland fans, and admitted mistakes had been made.
Since Short bought the club in 2009 - he became chairman in 2011 - the Black Cats have had seven full-time managers, but have faced the threat of relegation in almost every season.
""We need to improve both on and off the field, and despite the bitter disappointment there is a strong determination to do so throughout the club,"" said the American.
""There is significant work to be done over the summer and when the season is concluded, we intend to share our plans to move forward with our supporters.""
Listen as fans react to Sunderland's relegation on 606
This is the first time Moyes has been relegated as a manager, and he warned fans just two games into the the season that he thought they would struggle.
""I feel for the supporters because they're the people who pay their hard-earned cash to come and watch and we've not given them enough this season,"" said the former Everton and Manchester United manager.
""I've had 400-odd games in the Premier League and I've got an idea of what a good squad looks like.
""My feeling at the start of the season was it was going to be a hard graft, and I'd rather be up front with people than tell them something different.""
The defeat by Bournemouth was the ninth time Sunderland have failed to score in their past 10 games, and the 18th time they have failed to do so this season.
Jermain Defoe, the team's top scorer this season with 14, has not found the net in more than 15 hours of Premier League football.
""We've needed Jermain's goals,"" said Moyes.
""At times we haven't given him enough quality supply. But there has been other times, like today, when a couple of chances came. In the early part of the season he was getting them and finishing them.""
Moyes was given the Sunderland job after Sam Allardyce  left for his brief stint as England manager.
He has not been helped by injuries, with Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole, Duncan Watmore, Jordan Pickford, Paddy McNair and Victor Anichebe among the first-team players to have had lengthy spells on the sidelines.
Short said: ""I acknowledge that during my ownership mistakes have been made, particularly in the area of player recruitment, and as a result we have found ourselves struggling to survive in recent seasons.
""We had massive disruption during the summer transfer window, and an unprecedented number of injuries throughout the season.
""These are difficulties which we have been unable to overcome and we are paying the price for that now.""

Match of the Day pundit and former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer:
David Moyes has got to take responsibility as has the owner. It's been a disastrous season from start to finish. Mismanagement at all levels and they've signed some poor players. They've been flirting with relegations for a number of seasons and it was inevitable it was going to happen.
A £28m net spend in the last three transfer windows is comparable with teams in and around them, but I worry for Sunderland. There are two players that are assets in that team [Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe]. Other than that there's not too much in that squad that's worth a lot of money.
Match of the Day commentator John Motson:
A club badly managed from above for the last four years. At least three managers have got them out of it at the end of the season.
The rot set in at Sunderland a long time ago and it came right from the top.
I have no sympathy with them - they deserved to do down. I just hope somebody, whether it's David Moyes - a new owner perhaps - has got the opportunity to bring them back.
They have been a great club, they've got great fans but I'm afraid the way the club has been run, they've deserved what they got.
Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts:
Those Sunderland fans are seeing a team and a club that I think has lacked leadership from the boardroom.
That's why they have skipped from manager to manager with no real plan or identity.

Another businessman has been declared bankrupt twice but said it should not detract from the project's legitimacy.
Backers claim the £25bn barrage could generate 5% of Britain's electricity.
Hafren Power wants to build an 11 mile (17.7km) barrage between Lavernock Point near Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, and Brean near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.
Richard Bazley - the largest shareholder in Hafren Power - was declared bankrupt in 1977, 1994 and 2005.
Mr Bazley, described by Hafren Power as its founder and ""the visionary"" behind the barrage, describes himself as a ""serial entrepreneur"".
He declined to be interviewed but Hafren Power chief executive Tony Pryor denied Mr Bazley's background undermined the credibility of the project.
Another founder Idwal Stedman, who sits on Hafren Power's regional committee, has been declared bankrupt twice: in 1994 while working as an architect and in 2006 while working as an antiques dealer.
Although Hafren Power describes Mr Stedman as having run ""a highly regarded architecture firm,"" he is currently barred from calling himself an architect.
He was struck off by the Architects Registration Board last year after complaints about unpaid bills.
The board removed him from the register for ""conduct that is fundamentally incompatible with continuing to be an architect"".
Mr Stedman has also been the subject of seven separate county court judgements totalling more than £20,000 between 2009 and 2011.
He told BBC Wales in a statement: ""Richard Bazley and I originated the idea of a privately funded barrage seven years ago and have worked tirelessly since because we recognised the enormous value of the economic regeneration and clean energy. Without us, there would be no proposal.
""Today the project is maturing and growing, led by a new team of outside business talent. We are still involved and are shareholders.
""Past bankruptcies or mistakes, unconnected to the project, are of course painful for everyone involved. But they should not detract from the legitimacy of the barrage and its importance to Wales and the West of England.""
Supporters of the barrage say the privately-financed project could generate up to 5% of Britain's energy needs by using more than 1,000 turbines and tidal power.
But the project cannot go ahead without UK government support. Ministers say they want to see more detailed proposals before they allocate parliamentary time for a bill to allow the project to go ahead.
Neath Labour MP Peter Hain resigned from the shadow cabinet to campaign for the barrage. He declined to comment.
Supporters say the scheme would be financed by sovereign wealth funds and not require taxpayers' cash.
A similar project was rejected by the UK government in 2010 on grounds of cost, but Hafren Power says the revised barrage would overcome that issue and also be more environmentally friendly.
Backers say a barrage would create jobs and help tackle climate change, but opponents warn it would harm the local environment and endanger wildlife.",Serious questions about two of the founders of a project to build a barrage across the Severn estuary have been raised by a BBC investigation.

323,"Since 2005, he has worked from home on Wednesday mornings and then taken the rest of the day off.
Simmons and Simmons offers flexible working to all staff and makes this clear in recruitment ads.
It is a stance employers' organisation the CBI wants other firms to emulate, arguing it will improve diversity.
In a report aimed at encouraging employers to hire a broader range of people from varied social backgrounds, age groups, races and gender the CBI suggests advertising flexible working at the outset.
Just one in ten job adverts mention flexible working, despite more than half of employers offering it, meaning they miss out on a wider pool of applicants, according to the report.
The CBI also suggests that firms remove candidates' names from job applications in a bid to reduce ""unconscious bias"" in hiring decisions.
The organisation argues that firms with a broader pool of staff will perform better.
CBI president Paul Drechsler says: ""Inclusive workplaces give firms the chance to get ahead of their competitors by making better decisions, through diverse teams which draw on a wider range of ideas and experiences.""
Since 2014, Simmons & Simmons has allowed almost all its staff to work remotely one day a week of their choice without having to request permission from their boss.
It says the move was aimed at making ""flexible working a right rather than an exception"" and has seen a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have taken up flexible working.
Mr Taylor says in 2005 when he asked to work flexibly it was ""quite unusual"", but said he was granted permission in just three weeks. Being at home one day a week has enabled him to spend more time with his three children now aged 14, 12 and 9.
""At the time [when I asked] I was a relatively new partner and also a relatively new dad and had two young children and was worried i was not seeing a huge amount of them during the week.""
Now the children are older, he says he can pick them up from school as well as drop them off at activities. ""I haven't done anything particularly dramatic with the time, but it's nice to be there day-to-day and talk about what's going on at school.""
The change has also enabled Mr Taylor's partner to work later on a Wednesday, helping her progress at work, as well as make him feel loyal to the firm.
It is these sorts of factors that the CBI wants companies to be aware of. Mr Drechsler argues that flexible working should no longer be seen as ""a bonus for staff"", but instead as something that also has clear benefits for employers.
Other recommendations in the report include:
The report said data from earlier this month showing the UK's productivity still lags well behind other major economies meant employing a broader range of people was now more crucial than ever, and would help create more engaged employees.
""The economic and social challenges that the UK faces have been thrown into sharp relief by Brexit, in particular around issues like productivity, inclusion and opportunity,"" Mr Drechsler says.
""As businesses, it is up to us to seize the opportunities that exist to make some positive changes, becoming firms that will be competitive into the middle of the 21st century. If we get it right, business growth and greater opportunity will go hand in hand.""","""I didn't want to be a weekend dad,"" is how Julian Taylor, partner at law firm Simmons and Simmons, explains what drove him to ask for flexible working."
324,"A proposed scheme would have scrapped upfront relief, worth an estimated £21bn to savers, but made pension pot withdrawals tax free.
An alternative option was to set a flat rate of tax relief, which may have been unpopular with higher earners.
Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Osborne was ""yet again ducking a big decision"".
Campaigners said he had missed a ""huge opportunity"" to tackle pension inequality and help the lower paid.
But others said he was right to protect existing reliefs, and that radical reforms would have created new risks and imposed new administrative burdens on employers.
Mr Osborne had been expected to unveil changes in the Budget on 16 March, but a Treasury source said it was ""not the right time"" to make changes to pension tax relief.
The relief allows some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax to go into their pension instead.
Under the current system, pension savers receive tax relief at the same rate as their income tax - meaning basic rate taxpayers receive relief at 20% and higher rate taxpayers at 40 or 45%.
The proposal to introduce arrangements similar to an Isa, with no tax relief on contributions but with withdrawals free of tax, would have given a significant short-term boost to the government at the expense of lower tax revenue later.
An alternative option considered by the Treasury was for flat rate relief, which would have benefited basic rate taxpayers and cut reliefs for higher earners.
BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam
So a policy which hadn't been announced will now not be announced.
And the big winners of this non-announcement will be wealthy people. At the moment not only do they earn more, they also get a proportionately bigger tax top-up from the government when they save for their retirement.
If the chancellor had scrapped the tax relief entirely on pensions savings and created instead a new pensions Isa, that would have cost the better off (40p and 45p taxpayers) billions of pounds collectively.
The other proposal which had been reported was to create a new pension tax relief rate of 25p or even 33p. That would have punished higher earners as well but not by as much as the Isa-style option.
It would also have encouraged saving for retirement by the less well off (20p taxpayers) by, in effect, giving a pound for every four they saved.
Mick McAteer, co-director of the Financial Inclusion Centre, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""very disappointed"" that the government had stepped away from tackling the ""clear inequality in our pension system"".
Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, Britain's biggest pensioner organisation, said: ""The chancellor has wasted a golden opportunity to not only reform the unfair system of pension tax relief, but at the same time solve the funding crisis in social care.""
Conservative MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury select committee, acknowledged that the present system ""massively favours those people who are earning more money"" and told Today he favoured ""a fundamental rehash of the pension system"".
However, he said a flat rate relief would have been ""quite difficult to administer"" and more thought should be given to what reforms would work best.
Mr McDonnell said the chancellor was ""putting the interests of his party ahead of those of our country"".
""The big test for this Budget is whether it can start to lay the secure foundations for the economy of the future. This decision suggests George Osborne is only interested in securing the future leadership of his party.""
Former Liberal Democrat pensions minister Steve Webb, who now works in the pensions industry, said Mr Osborne had been right to resist changes.
He called for a ""period of stability"" in pensions policy in the interest of encouraging people to save for the long term.
Savers pay no tax on money they put into a pension but they do pay tax on what they take out each year beyond the personal allowance.
The government also allows pensioners to withdraw 25% of their pot tax free as a lump sum.
The way the relief works is that some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax can be contributed to their pension instead.
Pension savers receive tax relief at the highest rate of income tax they pay.
This means that the cost of a £10,000 pension contribution would, in effect, be £8,000 for a basic rate taxpayer because otherwise £2,000 would have gone in tax. For a 40% taxpayer the saving would be £4,000, and £4,500 for those at the 45% rate. So present arrangements favour the better off.
The amount anyone can save into a pension and receive tax relief on is capped at £40,000 annually and £1.25m in their lifetime.
Mr Osborne was warned ahead of the Budget that introducing Isa-style arrangements could prompt a mass withdrawal from pension funds.
Conservative MPs had also become concerned about the impact on their constituents of any move to flat rate relief, which would have reduced breaks for higher rate taxpayers.
BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Osborne's decision was also a recognition of how fragile the EU referendum campaign is and removed the risk of upsetting voters ahead of the vote on 23 June.
An ally of the chancellor told the Times that Mr Osborne did not want to put people off saving. ""Now isn't the right time, with uncertainty in the global economy and reforms such as auto-enrolment still bedding in, to turn things on their head.
The prospect of radical reform had also been opposed by the pensions industry.
Changes to the pensions system in recent years have included automatic enrolment into workplace pensions in 2012, and people aged 55 and over being allowed to take their retirement pots how they want rather than being required to buy an annuity retirement income - introduced in 2015.",Chancellor George Osborne has dropped plans to end or alter tax relief on pension contributions.
325,"Kilty, James Ellington, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Dwain Chambers are coached by Rana Reider, while Steve Fudge trains James Dasaolu and Adam Gemili.
""There were a couple of clashes of egos between the coaches and the athletes in both groups,"" said Kilty.
I know there is still tension between the other athletes in our group and their group and the two coaches
""That's the nature of the sport - there are always rivalries, so it's going to happen.""
Kilty won gold at the World Indoor Championships in Poland in March and will be making his first appearance on British soil since then when he takes part in the 100m at the BT Great CityGames in Manchester on Saturday.
The 24-year-old did not give details of how the friction started but said there had been ""a bit of tension"" and ""a few words exchanged"" at the British Athletics Indoor Championships in Sheffield in February.
""In one group you've got me, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and James Ellington, who are ranked first, second and third in the country at the moment, which is great,"" Kilty said.
""And then the other group has got Adam Gemili and James Dasaolu, who were the top best sprinters last year, so it's a massive rivalry.""
However, Kilty hopes the differences between the two camps can be settled for the benefit of the relay team, which will compete at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and European Championships in Zurich this summer.
""I try to keep it as professional as I can,"" added Kilty. ""They are all part of the British relay team and I think we all need to get along because, if the quickest relay team were to be put out there, you'd have two members of one group and two members of the other group.
""And we can smash the British record if we do. We can challenge the Jamaicans and the Americans with that squad as long as we can work together. It's a bit of a shame on that point, but hopefully we can work together.
""I'm on speaking terms and friendly with the others, but I know there is still tension between the other athletes in our group and their group and the two coaches.""
Dasaolu and Gemili will not be competing at the World Relay Championships in Bahamas on 24 and 25 May as the former is building his fitness after a hamstring injury and the latter has university exams.",World indoor 60m champion Richard Kilty says there is a rift between Britain's two male sprinting camps.
326,"John Lumsden Donaldson, 61, is well aware of what those organisations have been going through.
His business was ""virtually closed down for 24 hours"" when he was the victim of a similar attack.
And it was only the efforts of his computer programmer son Mark which got his business back up and running.
""It's not just the big companies that have been attacked,"" John told the BBC.
""We were attacked on Thursday 4 May.""
When John opened his doors that day as usual, he had little idea of the problems that lay in store.
He runs an auction company in Spain, where he lives in Formentera del Segura. It is a small business, employing fewer than ten people.
""None of the software would work on our network of computers in the office,"" he said.
""I thought my son might be updating the network.""
He rang his son to check.
""Within five minutes he rang back and told me to unplug the servers and close down the system.
""He said we were being hacked.""
John's business had been targeted with ransomware - software which infects vulnerable machines, locks data away and demands payment to unencrypt those files.
""They didn't take anything from us. They just wanted $500 (Â£390),"" John said.
""I said we should just pay. But my son said there was no guarantee they would unencrypt the files after we had paid and they might ask for more money.""
John's business uses two servers in England and two physical servers in Spain. All four use Windows operating systems - those in England running the newer Windows 10; those in Spain using an older iteration of Windows Server.
""They locked up our system files so we couldn't run any of our software or access customer data. We could not pay our customers.
""I was worried about the security of our clients but they didn't access any of that part. It was our physical servers in Spain.
""They found a backdoor in Windows Server through our telephone line.""
John and Mark worked overnight to resolve the problem.
""Even now we still have issues,"" John said. ""According to my son it's all linked to old Windows software.
""I really felt for our customers. It was a bit embarrassing to say the least.
""Thank God I had my son.""

327,"Economic nationalists like senior adviser Steve Bannon view withdrawal as visible way for the US to demonstrate that it's putting its own economic interests ahead of the concerns of the ""international community"".
Movement conservatives, including Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, are keen to strike a blow to the environmentalist coalition, which they view as creeping socialism cloaked in an earth-friendly guise.
Meanwhile Mr Trump's working-class supporters - particularly those in the economically distressed coal-producing regions of West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania that delivered an Electoral College victory to the president - are more concerned about jobs and their way of life, rather than the distant, amorphous threat of rising sea levels or shifting climate patterns.
Ivanka Trump, along with her husband (and senior White House adviser) Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defence James Mattis, were reportedly strong advocates for remaining in the agreement - for a range of environmental, diplomatic and national security reasons.
The president's daughter even arranged for her father to meet politician-turned-activist Al Gore to discuss the issue during the presidential transition.
The efforts always figured to be an uphill battle, however, given the issues and interests that formed the heart of Mr Trump's presidential campaign.
Mr Trump once notably called global warming a ""hoax"" perpetrated by the Chinese, but over the course of last year's campaign he was largely silent on environmental issues.
He spoke early and often about jobs, the economy and government overregulation, however, and will likely frame any move to abandon the Paris agreement as evidence that his presidency is taking action to put more money in American pockets.
If such a move angers the international elite, US liberals and media talking heads, so much the better.",While a presidential decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement would roil the international community and frustrate White House advocates of addressing climate change - including Donald Trump's own daughter - there are formidable forces within the administration in favour of such a move.
328,"Last year the authorities learned of 946 victims, compared with 710 in 2010, the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking said.
Trafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria and eastern Europe now pose the biggest threat to the UK , it said.
The government said better co-ordination between its departments and with authorities abroad was key.
But anti-slavery groups warned government ""failures"" had led to ""significant steps back"" in the fight.

In Ilford, East London, the police moved in at 05:15 BST, smashing through the door of an end of terrace house, but without result. It was empty.
The Met says it carries out two such raids every week, on average.
Two miles away in a second house, they found a Lithuanian family living in one room. A stack of mail showed that a large number of people have stayed there before.
They questioned the Lithuanians who said they were being paid below minimum wage to work in a recycling depot and building firm.
The room costs Â£140 a week. There was a CCTV camera watching the door of the house.
Are they victims of people trafficking? It's not clear, and often those involved haven't asked themselves the same question.
But police say those who try to run are often subject to violence.
There is currently no official figure for the number of victims trafficked into the country each year.
However, the report said 712 adult victims and 234 child victims were reported last year to the National Referral Mechanism, the official body that identifies and looks after those caught up in trafficking.
Of the victims referred in 2010, 524 were adults and 186 were children.
It is thought the increase could be explained by improvements in identifying victims, although campaigners say the figures of those being trafficked could be far higher as many victims choose not to come forward for fear of being deported.
The report suggested an increase in the number of children being forced into crime, including street begging.
The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre estimates there are about 300 child trafficking victims in the UK every year.
The report also detailed two cases of people trafficked for illegal organ removals, but they were detected and stopped before the operations were carried out.
One involved the planned sale of a victim's kidneys.
Det Insp Kevin Hyland, of London's Metropolitan Police - which sees the UK's highest rates of trafficking - said some victims travelled to the UK in lorries or containers but the majority arrived lawfully, often accompanied by their traffickers.
""The vast majority of them think they're coming to a better life in the UK,"" he said.
Mr Hyland said it was often ""almost impossible"" for border guards to spot victims because they often did not even know they were being trafficked.
Many victims are promised jobs in the hotel or leisure industry, or as interpreters, but when they arrive they are ""groomed or threatened"" and used for sexual exploitation, forced labour or both, he said.
In London, police deal with more than 100 cases of trafficking a year. Some will involve more than 400 victims but the majority involve about 10 to 15 people.
The report revealed the largest number of referrals of potential victims of trafficking were Nigerian nationals. From within Europe, Romanian nationals were the biggest group referred.
There are an estimated 92 organised crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking, it said.
And 142 defendants were charged with offences related to human trafficking in 2011/12.

The two potential victims of organ trafficking in the UK in 2011 are the first people identified as being forced into giving up their internal organs for transplant.
But it's still a small problem, with organ trafficking making up only 1% of all potential victims of trafficking last year, according to the Serious Organised Crime Association.
Cases of illegal organ trading are rare in the UK because of safeguards in place.
The Human Tissue Authority sees 1,200 cases a year of living organ donation - 95% involve kidneys and 5% liver lobes.
These cases include people making altruistic organ donations and those coming from abroad to donate organs to family members.
The HTA interviews all potential donors to make sure they are consenting freely and to ensure there is no reward or payment.
The process can take up to six months with the donor required to sign a form stating no coercion was involved.
Only when the HTA is satisfied would the operation be allowed to go ahead.
Advice is being drafted for NHS staff to help them identify potential cases of organ trafficking.
The report concluded intelligence sharing with international police forces was already ""proving effective"".
Immigration minister Mark Harper said the results demonstrated UK professionals were getting better at ""spotting"" the crime due to ""cross-government"" cooperation.
""We're doing a better job of cracking down people involved in the vile trade,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.
But the number of those prosecuted was ""not enough,"" he said.
""One of the things we do is to prosecute people for the most serious offences we can, and sometimes that's not a trafficking offence.""
Mr Harper also said agencies needed to ""make sure victims who are trafficked are treated as victims and not as offenders, which has happened in the past"".
Dr Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said Mr Harper ""must face up to the fact"" that the problem was worsening ""because of fundamental policy failures"".
He said the government viewed the problem ""through the lens of immigration"" and had allowed rights for migrant workers to slip from ""best practice"".
""It would be helpful if the government appointed a national commissioner on trafficking to make sure policy on this issue was unimpeded by politics.""
The report revealed thousands of ""front-line"" workers, including border staff, police and healthcare workers, have been trained to better identify, support and protect victims over the past two years.
Some airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Thomas Cook, are also training cabin crew to identify those who engaged in trafficking and their potential victims.
And a 24-hour confidential line has been set up for crew to report concerns to border officials before a plane lands in the UK.","The number of people being trafficked into the UK is rising, latest government estimates suggest."
329,"The final annual report from the Independent Monitoring Board for HMP Birmingham described staff morale as ""palpably low"" during the process.
After nearly three years, G4S Care and Justice Services took over the prison in October last year.
However, the board has also welcomed the new owner and ""looks forward to innovations"" that will help the prison.
The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) was concerned that the privatisation process, with promised announcements, was continually delayed.
It felt that the implementation, from the initial announcement on 31 March to the new owners taking over on 1 October, took too long.
The report praised prison staff who continued to cope with increasing problems, such as gang culture.
During the process, the Prison Service was also bidding to retain the contract and inmates were said to be concerned about the privatisation.
The IMB has recommended that ""lessons be learned from HMP Birmingham's experience"" and that similar processes should be shortened.
Nine other prisons will go through the market-testing process.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said: ""We will formally respond to the IMB report on HMP Birmingham in due course.
""The public have a right to expect continuing improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services, without compromising public safety.
""The competition strategy and adjustments to the prison estate will help ensure that this is the case, while achieving best value for taxpayers.""",A report has highlighted concerns over the process in which a prison became the first in the UK to be privatised.

331,"Here's a look back at some of the show's most memorable moments:
The birth of one of pop music's biggest beefs all started when Kanye West jumped on stage in the middle of Taylor Swift accepting her award for best female video.
When Swift's video for You Belong With Me beat Beyonce's Single Ladies, the rapper headed for the stage and took Taylor's microphone.
He said: ""Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'ma let you finish... but BeyoncÃ© had one of the best videos of all time.""
Kanye was booed by he audience, and when Beyonce herself accepted the award for video of the year later in the ceremony, she invited Swift back onstage to finish her speech.
Although Britney Spears was already a global superstar, this moment cemented her status as a pop culture icon as she performed her hit song I'm a Slave 4 U whilst draped with a seven-foot Burmese python.
Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and several other animal rights groups weren't too thrilled about this.
Recalling the performance last year, Britney said: ""Oh my goodness, why did I do that? That was so dumb,"" adding that she would ""never"" do it again.
Lady Gaga is no stranger to shocking the world with crazy outfits, and this one surely topped the list.
In 2010, the pop star accepted her video of the year award in a dress made from raw beef.
The dress was condemned by several animal rights groups but went on to be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.
In an  interview with American news anchor Anderson Cooper, Gaga explained that her dress was in protest against the US military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, a rule that banned open homosexuality in the armed forces.
Beyonce announced her pregnancy with Blue Ivy in the most Beyonce way ever.
After delivering a killer performance of Love On Top, she unbuttoned her blazer, dropped her microphone on the floor (we're sure the sound engineers were big fans of that) and began rubbing her tummy.
The audience (and her fanbase) went suitably crazy.
Madonna isn't a stranger to delivering crazy performances - from hanging on a crucifix to rocking up in a ball gown as a French royal, we've seen it all.
And whilst her 1984 performance at the VMAs would be considered quite tame by today's standards, at the time it was pretty groundbreaking.
From her wedding dress costume, to the massive cake she emerged from to her hip thrusting on stage, critics suggested Madonna had set the standard for other artists performing at the VMAs to match.
Britney and VMA stunts go hand-in-hand, so it's perhaps unsurprising she features more on our list than anybody else.
The singer started her 2000 performance in a tuxedo whilst singing I Can't Get No (Satisfaction). All very formal and elegant.
But then the whole world watched Britney rip off her clothes to reveal a skin-tone, bedazzled body suit as she began to sing Oops... I Did It Again.
Critics cited this moment as a turning point for Britney's career - between the song and the costume, she did a pretty good job of trying to shed that Mickey Mouse Club image and show the world she was growing up.
One of the most jaw dropping moments of VMA history was when Nicki Minaj called out Miley Cyrus.
It all started when the rapper criticised MTV for leaving Anaconda out of the video of the year category, implying that she would have been nominated if she was white.
Taylor Swift took this as a jab directed at her and responded on Twitter, after which the two engaged in a war of words. And then Miley weighed in on the topic.
""What I read sounded very Nicki Minaj, which, if you know Nicki Minaj, is not too kind,"" Miley said.
""It's not very polite. I think there's a way you speak to people with openness and love. You don't have to start this pop star against pop star war.""
As Nicki accepted her award on stage and handed back to Miley, who was hosting the ceremony, she said: ""And now, back to this [girl] that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. Miley, what's good?""
Nicki later explained to The New York Times Magazine: ""I saw [Miley] just looking at me, with her face screwed up, and I thought, 'What the...?'""
""The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls.""
And while we're on the subject of Miley Cyrus...
After finishing her performance of We Can't Stop in 2013, the singer was joined on stage by Robin Thicke and that's when things got a little... R-rated.
As Thicke began singing the controversial Blurred Lines, Cyrus began stroking him with a foam finger and doing her own interpretation of ""twerking"" in her latex beige bikini.
After Twitter melted, the singer defended it and claimed that she wanted to make history (mission accomplished) - but now it seems she regrets it.
Natia Kirkland - commonly known as Lil Mama - seemed to have got caught up in the moment when Jay-Z and Alicia Keys were performing their ode to New York, Empire State of Mind.
As the song came to a close, Kirkland who is also a native New Yorker, jumped on stage and posed next to the two superstars with Jay-Z trying his hardest to ignore her.
In the middle of performing a mash-up of hits in 2003, Madonna surprised the world by kissing Britney Spears onstage.
After cutting to the confused look on Justin Timberlake's face, Madonna then kissed Christina Aguilera.
At a time where both Spears and Aguilera were still trying to shake off their innocent teen-idol images, the kiss was an unforgettable VMA moment.

332,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also advised against packing the phones into any checked-in luggage.
Samsung recalled the phone last week after reports emerged of the device exploding during or after charging.
Qantas and Virgin Australia have also told customers not to charge or use the phone during flights.
Samsung said it would speed up shipments of replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones to ease safety concerns.
Earlier this week, US TV channel Fox 10 reported claims that a faulty Galaxy Note 7 had set fire to a family's Jeep.
Samsung has said that battery problems were behind the phones catching fire, but that it was difficult to work out which phones were affected among those sold.
""In light of recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the Federal Aviation Administration strongly advises passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage,"" the FAA said.
Following Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7, Qantas said on Thursday it was ""requesting that passengers who own [the devices] do not switch on or charge them in-flight.""
The phone was launched last month and has been otherwise generally well-received by consumers and critics.
Some 2.5 million Note 7s have been shipped globally.
Samsung has said customers who have already bought the phone will be able to swap it for a new one and that it would take about two weeks to prepare replacement devices.
Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter
This is precautionary advice and not understood to be in reaction to any incident on a plane.
But it does continue the headache for Samsung - even once the company goes through the motions of getting the device recalled, the Note 7 will forever be the exploding smartphone.
This is not the first time the FAA has warned about the dangers of lithium batteries on flights. Earlier this year, it urged airlines to assess the risk of transporting lithium batteries as cargo.
And the administration also insists that any spare lithium battery be kept with the passenger rather than kept with luggage in the hold - though as a person who regularly travels with big lithium batteries for camera equipment, I can tell you this is inconsistently enforced.
What makes lithium batteries catch fire?
The US trade group Airlines for America said it was ""closely monitoring"" the Note 7 issue and that carriers in the US would make their own ruling over the use of the phone on board.
""Each individual carrier makes determinations, in compliance with FAA safety rules and regulations, as to what is permitted to be carried on board and in the cargo hold,"" an Airlines for America spokesperson said in a statement.

She said they were sent to Sinn Féin who, so far, had not responded.
However, Sinn Féin's MLA Conor Murphy said they were ""insufficient"".
""There has been no agreement with the DUP on the terms of reference of an independent investigation,"" he said.
""In order to restore public confidence in the political institutions we need an independent investigation, which is robust, transparent, timeframed and led by a senior judicial figure from outside the jurisdiction and with the power to compel witnesses and subpoena documents.

Set up in November 2012, the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was an attempt by the Northern Ireland Executive to help to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources.
It is approximately £490m over budget as businesses were receiving more in subsidies than they were paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed.",Sinn Féin has said terms of reference drawn up by the head of the civil service for an investigation into the RHI debacle are short of what is required.
334,"The Ivorian left the Swans for the Etihad Stadium on a four-year contract in 2015 for a fee worth up to £28m.
Bony, 28, managed only eight goals in 46 appearances for City - more than half of which came as a substitute - and spent last season on loan at Stoke.
His potential return to Wales could depend on the future of Swansea's top scorer last season, Fernando Llorente.
The 32-year-old, who is currently sidelined with an arm injury, has been a transfer target for Chelsea, having worked with the Premier League champions' manager, Antonio Conte, at Juventus.
Swansea have yet to receive a bid this summer for the Spain international, who scored 15 goals last season to help the Welsh club avoid relegation from the top flight.
The Swans did reject offers for Llorente during the January transfer window, and a move for Bony could be seen as insurance should Llorente leave.
Swansea signed England Under-21 striker Tammy Abraham on a season-long loan from Chelsea earlier this summer.
But with club record signing Borja Baston on loan at Malaga, the Swans could be short of forward options if Llorente was to leave.
Before Baston's arrival, Bony was Swansea's record signing when he joined from Vitesse Arnhem for £12m in 2013.
He scored 34 goals in all competitions for the Swans before his move to City.

""He's doing great. So long as we're here, he'll be in the car next year.""
Horner's comments seem to end speculation that Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen might be promoted to the senior team after an impressive debut season for the 18-year-old Dutchman.
Red Bull's participation is still in doubt because they have not yet confirmed whether they have an engine for 2016.
The team were last month close to concluding negotiations to terminate their contract with Renault a year early due to growing tensions between the two.
But those talks stopped when it became clear Mercedes would not supply Red Bull and Ferrari said they could not supply them their 2016 engine next season.
Insiders say that Red Bull are now likely to continue with Renault but with the engine given a different name so it does not appear to casual audience as if the relationship has continued.
Renault are on the verge of taking control of the Lotus team and returning as a team owner and constructor.
However, Horner suggested there was still another possibility for Red Bull: ""There may be something else. We'll see.""

In a sport like rugby union, where players have never been bigger, faster, or hit harder for longer, might is right like never before. Which makes the continual influence of Dan Carter not just illogical but something close to miraculous.
On Saturday evening in Lyon, Carter - the leading points scorer in Test history, reigning World Rugby player of the year, World Cup winner for a second time seven months ago - will, in characteristically undemonstrative fashion, lead Racing 92's charge as they take on Saracens in the Champions Cup final.

The All Blacks great is not only a physical throw-back in a game increasingly for the outsized and enormous. At 5ft 10in and 14 stone, the 34-year-old plays an old-fashioned way: finding space where others seek contact, appearing unhurried when fly-halves have never had less time, still managing to play on instinct when set moves and patterns are everywhere you look.
It's not that Carter doesn't do the nasty stuff. In Racing's semi-final win over Leicester Tigers he made 16 tackles.
It's how he does it. Whereas Jonny Wilkinson, the original big-hitting number 10, stopped opposition runners like a rogue flanker and brought gasps from the stands and lungs of the victim alike, Carter tackles like he does everything else - with economy rather than anger, with perfect yet undemonstrative technique, with efficiency over ostentation.
Carter is not quite the player he was. The outside break and sudden acceleration that defined so many of his early masterclasses have quietly been lost to the years. It doesn't really matter. In his swansong he appears to worry less about what he lacks than utilise what he does.
If it wasn't the sort of thing that in his home town of Southbridge would trigger disbelief - expressed, because this is the South Island of New Zealand, by something as flamboyant as a raised eyebrow or muted cough - you'd say it was all rather Zen: the impossible calm in a sporting storm, the balance between self and team, equanimity in even the biggest occasions.
There is the ritual of his relentless kicking practice, whether at the posts that his father put up next to the family home or on the foreign fields of France; the meditation brought about by those repeated simple actions; the carefully constructed humility of an All Blacks environment where 100-cap heroes like Carter and retired captain Richie McCaw were expected to clean up the dressing room like backroom juniors.
And it is all done in the most unobtrusive way. Wilkinson kicked from the tee with such exaggerated movements that half-cut punters in pubs could do impressions. Dan Biggar has his little soft-shoe shuffle, the 'Biggarena'. Owen Farrell, Carter's opposite number on Saturday, has the laser eyes and robotic head-turn.
Carter? Even after so many penalties and conversions, it's still hard to remember exactly how he looks in sweet motion. The fact that he has been the same with ball in hand - perfectly timed passes or offloads, but all done in the most discreet and understated way - have sometimes made it hard for people to understand what has made him so special. He doesn't always stand out, so how can he be outstanding?
""He's fascinating,"" admits Ronan O'Gara, arguably Ireland's finest fly-half and now, in early retirement, assistant coach at Carter's Racing.
""He's just extremely humble, extremely respectful. He smiles, he always finds a way of getting the job done.
""He doesn't stress, he's always polite, he's a breath of fresh air. You can learn an awful lot by just watching him.""
Carter isn't the only sporting great who can appear to be operating in slow-motion and fast-forward at the same time, but he maintains that composure longer than most.
Tennis' Roger Federer at his best was both unhurried and unflustered, but at the moment of victory all that held-back emotion would come crashing out. In cricket, Chris Gayle remains expressionless when thrashing unfortunate bowlers for six after six, but will dance with his top off when victory has been won.
Lionel Messi, for all the gossamer touches with that left foot, is all beautiful bustle and obvious energy, Cristiano Ronaldo all strut and preen on the football pitch.
Even Tiger Woods, who before his fall could hold his form and nerve in the final-round meltdown like no other golfer, would spit and cuss his way round the course when the mojo left his side.
Carter, in the biggest moments he has faced, has looked as perturbed as if he were back at Christchurch Boys' High School, from the second Test against the Lions in 2005, when he turned in a performance that led to him being described as ""the perfect 10"", all the way through to last October's World Cup final.
Against the Wallabies at Twickenham that day, there was a moment to epitomise so much of what had come before: the All Blacks suddenly under huge pressure, their 17-point lead cut to just four with 15 minutes to go.
In his first 110 Tests Carter had landed a total of just six drop-goals. A week after adding another to put away South Africa in the semi-finals, he took a pass flat with the defence charging, his feet and eyes set for the short pass to Sonny Bill Williams on his outside shoulder.
Forty metres out, the game's greatest prize in the balance, chaos all around. Not for Carter. Instead, a little pocket of space and tranquillity and time where no-one else could see it, a turn of the shoulders and hips, a perfect contact with his left boot to send the ball arcing between the sticks.
Wilkinson was also touched by Eastern philosophy, first by Buddhism as cruel injuries kept keeping him out, later by a Japanese school of thought called Kaizen.
Because of the man that Wilkinson is, that was more about a tortured form of self-improvement. ""You imagine being watched by a video 24/7 to help you get better each day and make good decisions,"" he has said.
For Farrell, who shares much of Wilkinson's dedication, Saturday is also about a particular kind of personal development.
After his yellow card in the critical World Cup group match against Australia and the two-week ban for a dangerous tackle after Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final win over Wasps, he will be watching Carter not just to keep his influence in check but to learn from the old master too.
""It's just how calm he is, how much he is in control of what he does that stands out,"" the fiery Farrell says.
""Trying to be calmer on the pitch, it's definitely something I'm always trying to do. The more you're calm, the more you're in control and the more you're thinking about the right things.""
Carter in control. The career moves on, but the philosophy remains the same.

337,"Extra patrols have been launched to deal with an increase in anti-social behaviour fuelled by the drug, said to leave users in a ""zombie-like"" state.
Officers were called to 58 incidents related to Spice in the city centre between Friday and Sunday.
""We cannot afford"" for the problem to get worse, Ch Supt Wasim Chaudhry said.
Effects of the synthetic drug can be extreme, causing hallucinations, psychosis, muscle weakness and paranoia.
Ch Supt Chaudhry said officers were doing all they could to tackle the issue but ""a multi-agency approach is the only way we can fight this battle"".
""The truth is, tackling the issues caused by Spice is putting pressure on public services and is taking up a lot of our resources, particularly in Manchester city centre,"" he said.
""Those who take Spice are often left incapacitated or seriously ill and need the help of our partners in the NHS and ambulance service.
""They can also become aggressive and become a danger to themselves and others.""
He said it was ""a problem that we cannot afford to get any worse"".
The Greater Manchester force has increased the number of specially-trained officers dealing with the issue.
It has also been working with Manchester City Council's adults and children's services, rough sleeper and outreach teams, local charities, as well as North West Ambulance Service and the NHS, he said.
Councillor Pat Karney said he wanted to discuss the problem with Home Secretary Amber Rudd because ""the experience in Manchester is going to spread up and down this country"".
""What is happening in Manchester will happen nationally so the next steps we're taking is to see the chief constable and review the situation, and then we're going to be seeking a meeting with the home secretary,"" he said.
Daniel Gerrard, Founder of Addiction Helper and Family Interventionist, believes that the term 'Legal High' is where the problem really started, as it stigmatised the drugs in such a way that it made them more widespread and acceptable to use.
""Illegal Highs like Spice should be classed as Category A Drugs. This will allow us to educate those using and those thinking of trying it for the first time that extremely serious consequences are attached with this drug.
""My experience with those addicted to Spice is that they can be very volatile and present with mental health issues, often without mental health being an issue prior to using Spice.
""The fact of the matter is that more and more addicts are dying and the addiction problem continues to rise. Addiction treatment should not be reduced because of austerity, as the recent crisis with this drug should make quite clear.""","A rise in the use of former legal high Spice in Manchester is putting pressure on public services, police say."
338,"The ""virtual orchestra"" included everything from bell ringers to cellists, all of whom had uploaded their performance to the BBC.
A video combining all 1,200 performances was shown at Proms in the Park events around the UK and as part of BBC Two's coverage of the event.
The Prom also featured an unusual rendition of Rule Britannia.
Peruvian Juan Diego Florez chose to sing the anthem in B Major - the highest pitch ever chosen by a tenor at the event.
""I think it's more comfortable, more exciting, more fun,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm glad that I'm the first one doing it.""
The musician stole the show by performing the song in the colourful costume of Manco Capac, governor and founder of the Inca civilization.
Earlier, the dashing tenor had serenaded a cuddly toy of fellow Peruvian Paddington Bear during a performance of Guantanamera - part of a medley of popular Latin songs.
""He is as Peruvian as me,"" he told the audience. ""You know, he was found in Paddington Station... [but] nobody in Peru knows about this.
""Anyway, I know him, I love him.""
The build-up to the Last Night was marked by an attempt to hijack the concert's tradition of flag-waving for political means.
Anti-Brexit campaigners handed out EU flags outside the Royal Albert Hall, hoping for a wave of support from Prommers, who more usually wave union flags during the last night.
The organisers, who wanted to remain anonymous, said in a statement: ""Music doesn't recognise borders, religion, gender, age, status or creed and most orchestras, shows and music schools rely heavily on talented musicians from inside and outside the EU.""
They added: ""Accordionist Romano Viazzani summed it up perfectly when he said: 'Music is the universal language. It builds bridges and tears down walls.'""
Prominent Brexit backer Aaron Banks retaliated by pledging to hand out five times as many union jacks as the Brexit team.
In the end, neither side prevailed - as the Royal Albert Hall sported flags from all around the world, including the German, Australian, Danish, Welsh and Cornish flags.
There was also a distinctly international flavour to the programme, conducted by Sakari Oramo, the Finnish music director of the BBC Symphony Orchestra.
He led the musicians through works by French, German, Russian and Italian composers; while Anne Dudley contributed a special arrangement of Fiesta Caribena!
Perhaps in response to the planned protest, Oramo told the audience: ""Listening to music in a concentrated way gives us the chanceâ€¦ to find resolution, peace and unity.
""Music enables us to be in dialogue with each other, and our innermost selves. A dialogue which is more necessary in these days than ever before.""
The concert also included Michael Torke's Javelin, which was originally performed at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a hand-picked selection of young singers performing Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music - a tribute to Henry Wood, whose name is synonymous with the Proms.
In keeping with tradition, the concert - and the 2016 season - closed with Rule Britannia, Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem.
Around the UK, classical music fans were able to join in the celebrations at Proms in the Park events; with special appearances by pianist Ruth McGinley and soprano Lesley Garret in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
Thirteen-year-old Gwydion Rhys was given the opportunity to conduct the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in a performance of Ride of the Valkyries at the Welsh Prom, in Colwyn Bay.
Britain's Got Talent winners Collabro appeared at the Scottish leg, in Glasgow Green; while London's line-up included Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Rick Astley, Sir James Galway, Tim Minchin and the cast of Matilda The Musical.
The events brought the two month-long Proms season to a close, after more than 100 concerts.
Highlights included the  SimÃ³n Bolivar Orchestra, from Caracas, who put on a colourful, exotic evening, full of evocations of Latin America; and  a spine-tingling programme of Steve Reich, performed on the roof of a Peckham car park.
A late night Prom paid tribute to the life and music of David Bowie, with mixed results; while Quincy Jones and Strictly Come Dancing were also honoured with their own programmes.

The midfielder revealed he had spoken first to the Celtic striker before signing his four-year contract.
""Moussa told me the club was good, it was fun here,"" said his fellow 21-year-old, who spent the last two seasons on loan with Genoa in Serie A.
""I'm very happy to be here and it's a new challenge for me.""
Ntcham never made the breakthrough into the senior side at the Etihad but did make 41 appearances during his two-year spell in Italy, 22 of them starts.
Genoa finished 11th in his first campaign in Serie A, but the Frenchman made only 10 starts as the Red and Blues ended last season in 16th place, two spots above the relegation zone.
He now hopes to mirror the success of compatriot Dembele, whose stunning debut season in Scottish football following his transfer from Fulham has led to him being linked with a move to some of European football's biggest clubs.
The France Under-21 striker was a team-mate of Ntcham's earlier in their international age-grade careers, recalling: ""I was maybe 14 when we played together.""
And the new arrival hopes Dembele sticks around to help him adapt to life in Scotland.
""He knows not all clubs are in the Champions League, so if you play in the Champions League, it's always good to stay,"" said Ntcham.
""That's why I chose to come here.""
Ntcham revealed he held talks with Celtic back in January and says a desire to play regular first-team football was a key factor in his decision to leave England's top flight and join Brendan Rodgers' squad.
""I spoke with Brendan before,"" he said. ""In January, Celtic was already there for me when I was in Italy, so that's why I came here.
""He said to me: 'You have to play because, if you don't play, you don't improve. You have to play because in Italy you don't play a lot'.
""It wasn't a tough decision for me. It was a normal decision because at Manchester City I play three years there and sometimes it is better to leave. Football is like this sometimes.""
Ntcham moved to City's youth ranks in 2012 from the Le Havre academy in his homeland and has represented France at every youth level from under-16s upwards.
Asked what kind of player Celtic fans can expect, he said: ""I am a powerful player and technical as well I think.""

340,"Ilkeston in Derbyshire is one of the largest towns in the UK without a rail station after its previous one closed in 1967, due to Dr Beeching's cuts.
However, the project suffered several delays, notably because of newts that had to be trapped and relocated.
The station, off Millership Way, is due to open later this year.
Plans to dismantle the old bridge were postponed after foundation work on the new platforms took longer than expected.
It is the latest delay to the project which first got the go-ahead in January 2014 - work was due to start six months later.
However, the rare newts - a species protected by law - were found during a routine ecological site survey and work was ordered not to begin until they were removed.
Flooding concerns at the site delayed the project further, and again in February 2015 when even more newts were found, prompting some to question the species' rarity.
The delays ""disappointed"" local councillors and ""frustrated"" the then transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.
Work finally started to demolish the old station in March 2015.
Councillor Dean Collins, from the county council, said: ""The new station will be a great boost to the area.
""Large-scale engineering projects like this can often unearth unforeseen issues and while we've had a few setbacks, we're working hard to get the station up and running as soon as we can.""
A number of road closures will be in place while the old footbridge is taken down and the new one erected.
Once the station opens, services to Chesterfield, Sheffield, Leeds and Nottingham will begin with 160,000 passengers expected to pass through the station.",Work has started on a footbridge at the site of a £10m railway station where construction efforts stalled due to concerns over rare great crested newts.

The CCTV footage shows the man pouring liquid around and setting it alight.
He is about 5ft 10in tall and was wearing a blue tracksuit, a hat with an luminous rear band and dark shoes.
Det Con Stephen Cooke, of Police Scotland, said: ""This was a deliberate and dangerous act which has caused extensive damage to the centre.

342,"But the ""You Stink"" campaign said the decision did not mean it was giving up.
The move comes after two days of demonstrations in the capital descended into clashes in which dozens of protesters and police were hurt.
Prime Minister Tammam Salam has appealed for calm and threatened to resign over the crisis.
In a televised address on Sunday, he warned that Lebanon was heading towards collapse, with the country's ""political garbage"" crippling his unity cabinet.
Thousands of people gathered outside the prime minister's office in central Beirut on Sunday to protest against the government's failure to have the large piles of rubbish which have been building up in the capital for weeks removed.
Chanting ""the people want the downfall of the regime"", some protesters threw rocks and sticks at riot police and lit fires. Officers responded by firing water cannon and tear gas.
The clashes left at least 44 demonstrators and 30 police officers injured, officials said. Dozens of people were also injured on Saturday, when police fired rubber bullets.
Like the issue of electricity in Iraq, the failure of a public utility in Lebanon - rubbish collection - has brought to a head simmering, chronic public indignation over a deadlocked political system riddled with corruption, inefficiency and sectarianism.
As the embattled Prime Minister Tammam Salam pointed out, it is this issue that threw the spotlight on the ""political rubbish"" that is the real problem - one that has paralysed his own cabinet and the twice-prorogued parliament from taking effective decisions on any issue.
Behind the political stagnation is the unbending stand-off between the two major political blocs, divided primarily over attitudes to the Syrian regime - the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its mainly Shia allies on one side, and the Saudi-backed, mainly Sunni pro-Western 14 March movement.
Mr Salam's warning of an imminent collapse should be a wake-up call to those blocs that it is time to collaborate on solutions, not least to the 15-month vacancy at the country's presidency. That seems unlikely, with regional struggles as unresolved as they are.
Protesters are also broadening their demands to include an end to the pervasive sectarian political system, something that is even harder to imagine.
But public pressure is mounting. If it can at least get the rubbish collected and safely disposed of, that will be a start.
Lebanon wracked by dysfunction
Lebanon cartoons vent anger at rubbish crisis
On Monday, the campaign announced that the demonstration planned for Monday evening had been postponed.
""The movement has not and will not stop,"" a statement on its Facebook page said. ""Postponing from today to another date this week is not a retreat. We need to reassess and organise our demands.""
You Stink leader Hassan Shams earlier blamed ""infiltrators"" for the violence over the weekend. ""We started peacefully, and we will continue peacefully,"" he told New TV.
The protests have been largely co-ordinated by You Stink, which was formed when rubbish began piling up on the streets of Beirut and neighbouring areas after the country's largest landfill was closed last month, with no ready alternative.
Activists blame political paralysis and corruption for the failure to resolve the crisis.
Fouad al-Hassan, a 65-year-old actor, told the New York Times that he had decided to attend Sunday's rally because he wanted to ""change the system"".
""We want new blood or the country will stay the same,"" he added.
Lebanon has been without a president for more than a year, while members of parliament have extended their own terms until 2017 after failing to agree on a law to govern fresh elections.
The conflict in neighbouring Syria has also exacerbated political and sectarian divisions, and resulted in the arrival of 1.1 million refugees, putting a strain on the economy and public services.
Mr Salam said that if a cabinet meeting scheduled for Thursday was not productive on several issues, including the rubbish crisis, ""there would be no necessity for the government after it"".
""I warn that we are going towards collapse if matters continue,"" he added.
""Frankly, I have not and will not be a partner in this collapse. Let all officials and political forces bear their responsibilities.""
The prime minister also warned that the government, which brings together all the main Lebanese parties, would be unable to pay civil servants' salaries next month and risked being classified a ""failing state"".
If Mr Salam were to resign it could trigger a constitutional crisis because his replacement has to be appointed by the president.",Organisers of protests over the failure of Lebanon's government to clear rubbish from the streets of Beirut have postponed a rally planned for Monday.
343,"The Colin Tizzard-trained seven-year-old ranged up alongside Willie Mullins' Un De Sceaux (10-11 fav) at the final fence and pulled clear on the run-in.
Fox Norton (5-2),  who also won the Melling Chase at Aintree, got home by a length and three quarters.
God's Own (7-1), last year's winner, was just half a length away in third.
The victory gave jockey Robbie Power a seventh Grade One win of the campaign.
Fox Norton has been a model of consistency since joining the Tizzard team, and was a close second to Special Tiara in the Queen Mother Champion Chase.
He was not inconvenienced by the return to two miles, with the strong pace set by Un De Sceaux and Rock The World playing to his strengths.
""Robbie was cool. He didn't get involved in any battles until he had to,"" said Tizzard. ""The horse made a few mistakes and Robbie said he was going flat out the whole time.
""If you saw this horse on the gallops you'd never think he was a champion two-miler. Honestly, slow three-milers would beat him.
""This is why we get up in the morning and why we go looking at horses, to come and win at places like Punchestown. It's fantastic.""
Asked if Fox Norton could step up in trip next season, Tizzard added: ""I think there's every temptation.
""That was his minimum and if there had been a two-and-a-half-miler here he would have been in that.
""He'd get three miles, but of course Sizing John is there. I think he'd get two and a half or three.""
Mullins said of Un De Sceaux: ""We've had a fantastic season with him and will put him away now.
""The faster pace over two miles on better ground didn't suit him.""

Fox Norton took the notable scalp of Un De Sceaux, who has only previously been beaten in completed races in Ireland and Britain by the great Sprinter Sacre, and continues to live up to the type of expectations the Tizzard team has for him.

""You are going to get the best of British competing cheek-by-jowl against the best of the rest of the world. The track and field is the centrepiece of the Olympics and is the main event. I think Team GB are set for their best Olympics ever, as not only are they wonderfully talented, but they'll be competing in front of a partisan crowd. Dai Greene and Mo Farah will be going for gold. Christine Ohuruogu is the defending 400m champion and is raring to go. After all the controversy surrounding South Africa's Caster Semenya, it is going to be great to see her put that all behind her in London. She is definitely the woman to beat in the 800m.""
That athletics event remains the Games' ultimate showstopper and all eyes will be trained on Usain Bolt in the men's final on Sunday 5 August.
But athletics is not just about the track events; there are 47 medal events in all and just over half of these (24) are on the track. The field events, such as the triple jump and javelin, are also popular and have provided Great Britain with Olympic medals in recent years.
For those unable to get tickets for the Olympic Stadium, there are five road races being held on the streets of central London and finishing at the Mall. The women's marathon will see British world record holder Paula Radcliffe attempt to win gold at the third time of asking.
The athletics concludes with the relay races on 11 August, which should provide a fascinating finale. The men's 4x100m has been dominated by the USA but Jamaica - led by that man Bolt - broke the world record to win gold in Beijing.
Athletics offer the widest range of choice of any Olympic sport as its various disciplines provide the opportunity to throw, run or jump.

Immense core physical strength is required to throw a shot put that weighs 16 pounds for men and 8.8 pounds for women.
The test of endurance posed by the marathon sees athletes burn up to 3593 calories running a 26.2 mile course.
For those looking to follow in Bolt's footsteps, research has found sprinting offers a harder workout than slow and steady cardiovascular work such as long-distance running.
It is also an efficient way to reduce body fat and strengthen the heart muscles.
As training sessions are often carried out in groups, it is an excellent way to develop communication skills and learn to work effectively with other people. Clubs also offer a variety of social events beyond simply playing the sport.
Great Britain's Kelly Holmes became the oldest winner of the women's 800m when clinching gold in 2004. The 34-year-old had plenty more to give though - five days later she produced a memorable sprint finish to win the 1500m.

The word athletics is derived from the Greek word 'athlos,' which means ""contest"" or ""task,"" and the sport was first run in an Olympic format in that part world.
Before then, running, walking, jumping, and throwing-based sports had all been performed in a variety of different guises far back into antiquity. Ancient Egyptian tombs dated to approximately 2250 BC have been found that contained depictions of running and high jump competitions.
Discus thrower Jules Noël of France was denied a medal in 1932 when the judges were distracted watching the pole vault and didn't see where his best throw had landed; it would likely have won him gold. Noël, who sneaked off to drink champagne during the competition, was awarded an extra throw but was unable to improve on fourth place.
The first event contested in the ancient Olympic Games was the ""stadium"" race, a sprint of about 192 metres, with recorded winners dating back as far as 776 BC.
The modern format of athletics, competed at a single meeting involving numerous disciplines, evolved in the late 19th century, with the earliest recorded meeting in 1840 in Shropshire, England.
The formation of the Amateur Athletic Association in England in 1880 provided the sport with its first national governing body.
The American Amateur Athletic Union and French Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques followed before the end of that decade.
Athletics has been on the programme of each edition of the Games since 1896, with women's events appearing for the first time at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam.
More on the IOC website",It is perhaps fitting that the very first race of the modern Olympics in 1896 was the men's 100 metre sprint.
345,"Members of the EIS union will raise the prospect of industrial action at their annual general meeting this week.
Teachers will also consider action if workload issues remain unresolved after a survey claimed the average teacher worked 46.5 hours a week.
EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan, said: ""These issues must be tackled.""
A Scottish government spokesman said they were working with teachers' representatives, local authorities and other partners ""to address concerns around workload"".
EIS members in Dundee have said that the union's council must ""campaign for a restorative pay deal for teachers which does not link an increased salary with detrimental changes to conditions of service"".
Their motion adds: ""If no satisfactory outcome is forthcoming, members are to be balloted for industrial action up to and including strike action.""
Other motions to be debated at the conference, which will take place in Perth from Thursday to Saturday, could lead to industrial action as a result of changes to the exam system.
The East Ayrshire local association has put forward a motion calling for a ""ballot for a boycott of all SQA-related work unless SQA assessment can be managed within the 35-hour working week.""
Mr Flanagan said: ""Despite the fine words of politicians on the need to support schools and teachers, the evidence from both the recent EIS workload survey - which highlighted an average teacher working week of 46.5 hours - and the range of motions to this year's AGM indicate that excessive workload remains a huge issue for teachers and, therefore, for our schools and our pupils.""
He insisted: ""The message to the Scottish government, to local authorities and national education bodies could not be clearer - you must take action, now, to lighten the load on our schools and our teachers.""
A call for the EIS to ""investigate and report on the impact of teacher shortages"" will also be discussed at the conference, along with a motion condemning ""budget cuts which have been inflicted on Scottish education in recent years"".
A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We are committed to making sure councils have the right number and highest quality of teachers in our schools, which is why we have offered councils Â£51m, including an additional Â£10m over and above last year's settlements to support teacher numbers.
""Education and closing the gap in attainment between children from the most and least deprived communities is a top priority for this government.""","Teachers could be set to strike if they fail to get a ""satisfactory outcome"" in talks over pay, union leaders have warned."

The Welsh Government has applied for a £6.8m grant for part funding from the UK government for the project which would include a new train station and interchange plus car parking and bus stops.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said he had submitted a ""strong"" application for 75% of the cost of the new station - the maximum the UK Government could cover.
He said the Welsh Government would provide the remaining 25% of the funding - £1.7m.
Proposals for a new station at Bow Street have been shown at a public event and, if approved, is hoped will open in 2019.
It would be built a short distance south of the original station, which is now the site of a builders' merchants.

350,"AMC chief executive Adam Aron had suggested the idea might encourage so-called millennials to visit the cinema.
But the plan was badly received on social media, where cinema-goers bombarded AMC with messages.
""We have heard loud and clear that this is a concept our audience does not want,"" the company said in a statement.
AMC operates almost 400 cinemas in the United States, with more than 5,000 screens. The chain also has a UK multi-screen complex in Manchester.
While many cinemas display messages before films asking people to switch off their mobile devices, Mr Aron had suggested that allowing mobile phone use during a film might appeal to young adults.
""When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow,"" he had explained in an interview with Variety magazine.
But the cinema chain has now admitted the idea had not gone down well with audiences.
""In this age of social media, we get feedback from you almost instantaneously,"" it said in a statement.
""This is an idea we have relegated to the cutting room floor... there will be no texting allowed in any of the auditoriums at AMC Theatres.""

351,"Francis used his ""Urbi et Orbi"" address to call for peace in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and across the globe.
He singled out ""dear Syria"", saying: ""How much blood has been shed! And how much suffering must there still be before a political solution is found?""
Easter is the most important festival in the Christian calendar and pilgrims have attended church across the world.
By David WilleyBBC News, Rome
In past years there have been two parts to the Pope's Easter message - a heartfelt appeal for peace in the world's trouble spots, and multilingual  greetings to the crowds thronging St Peter's Square.
There were 250,000 people from more than 100 countries present this morning.
But Pope Francis decided to cut the vernacular greetings.
He is, of course, most comfortable speaking his native Spanish, and he is also completely fluent in Italian as his family is from Piedmont in northern Italy.
Pope Francis was, however, almost incomprehensible when he tried out a few words in English to the crowds in St Peter's Square last week.
So he decided not to read out the  ""Happy Easter"" greetings that had been prepared for him in 65 different languages including difficult-to-pronounce oriental tongues.
Popes John Paul II and Benedict used to struggle to pronounce even a short phrase in Burmese,  Chinese or Korean, Pope Francis chose not even to try.
But his body language spoke volumes. He was completely at ease saluting families, kissing babies and tenderly embracing a young disabled man, as the Pope was driven in an open jeep around the packed square.
Pope Francis also speaks when he remains silent.
Pope Francis, formerly Buenos Aires Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was elected on 13 March, becoming the first non-European pope for almost 1,300 years.
He replaced Benedict XVI, who held the office for eight years and became the first pontiff in more than 700 years to resign, saying he no longer had the physical strength to continue.
In his Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world) speech, Pope Francis began with a simple ""Happy Easter!""
The 76-year-old Pope, who has begun his tenure by emphasising humility, went on: ""Christ has risen! What a joy it is for me to announce this message... I would like it to go out to every house and every family, especially where the suffering is greatest, in hospitals, in prisons.""
Later in his speech, Pope Francis said: ""We ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.""
The Pope then mentioned troubled regions of the world in turn.

""Peace for the Middle East, and particularly between Israelis and Palestinians, who struggle to find the road of agreement, that they may willingly and courageously resume negotiations to end a conflict that has lasted all too long.
""Peace in Iraq, that every act of violence may end, and above all for dear Syria, for its people torn by conflict and for the many refugees who await help and comfort.""
For Africa, the Pope referred to Mali, Nigeria - ""where attacks sadly continue"" - the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.
He added: ""Peace in Asia, above all on the Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a  renewed spirit of reconciliation grow.""

Pope Francis concluded by saying: ""Peace in the whole world, still divided by greed looking for easy gain, wounded by the selfishness which threatens human life and the family, selfishness that continues in human trafficking, the most extensive form of slavery in this 21st Century.""
BBC Rome correspondent, Alan Johnston, says the Pope has reinforced his image as a man of simple, down-to-earth tastes, not wearing the more ostentatious of papal costumes and, for the moment, not moving into the grandiose papal apartments.
One pilgrim in Rome on Sunday, Briton Tina Hughes, said that Francis represented a ""new beginning"".
""I think he brings something special. He connects with people. I feel good about him,"" she told Reuters.
In the days before Easter, the Pope had reached out to women and Muslims.
During a Holy Thursday Mass at a youth detention centre he washed and kissed the feet of 12 people, including two girls and two Muslims, and in a Good Friday procession referred to the ""friendship of our Muslim brothers and sisters"" in the Middle East.
But our correspondent says that, after Easter, the Pope will have to begin tackling the key issues facing the Catholic Church, such as reforming a Vatican bureaucracy riven by infighting and allegations of corruption, and tackling the issue of clerical sexual abuse.
Vatican watchers will also be keeping a keen eye on new appointments to key positions.
In his Easter homily, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Fouad Twal, invited the Pope to visit.
The patriarch, the most senior Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, also urged the international community to take ""concrete and effective decisions to find a balanced and just solution for the Palestinian cause, which lies at the heart of all the Middle East's troubles"".",Pope Francis has delivered a passionate plea for peace in his first Easter Sunday message since being elected.
352,"Cheshire East Council said ""deliberate and systematic manipulation"" took place from 2012 to 2014.
Cheshire Police is investigating whether any crimes were committed.
The council has apologised and said the falsified figures had caused ""serious problems"" in assessing applications for new developments.
""Serious"" errors in the council's air quality data readings, from 2012 to 2014, made them appear lower than they really were, an external investigation has revealed.
Falsified data ""may have affected"" decisions made on planning applications in Nantwich, Congleton, Crewe, Holmes Chapel and Sandbach, it concluded.
Emails seen by the BBC last month showed that auditors believed the number and nature of the inaccuracies meant human error was ""unlikely"" to have been responsible.
Sean Hannaby, the council's director of planning and sustainable development, said: ""We would like to assure everyone that we have done everything we can to rectify these failings.
""There are no immediate health protection measures needed as a result of these errors.""
Councillors have to decide if a development will:
All UK local authorities are obliged to monitor local air quality and submit their findings to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
Defra said the data provided ""an overview of pollution in locations where people are likely to be present and reveals historic trends which indicate whether policies to improve air quality are having the desired effect"".
Air pollutants include nitrogen dioxide from exhaust emissions which the government has been ordered to cut.
If a council does not meet national objectives it is obliged to declare an Air Quality Management Area and publish an action plan.
An internal review by Cheshire East Council auditors in 2016 found the air quality data submitted was different to the original data provided by the laboratory that analysed readings from the council's monitoring equipment.
The falsified data was from testing stations ""spread over a wide geographical area, which implies that the manipulation was not motivated by a wish to favour specific sites"", the council's report summary said.
Cheshire East Council has not commented on any potential disciplinary action.
A Defra spokesperson said: ""We are aware of this issue and understand the local authority is now considering its response to the investigation.""","Hundreds of planning applications are to be reviewed after a council admitted its air pollution data was ""falsified"" to make it look cleaner."
353,"It follows claims the social media giant had not done enough to tackle cyberbullies or extremists in the past.
In a blog, the firm said the new language emphasised it would ""not tolerate behaviour intended to harass or intimidate"".
It also said it had clarified what it considered to be ""abusive behaviour and hateful conduct"".
This includes:
The firm promised to suspend or close the accounts of users who ""cross the line into abuse"".
Pressure is growing on social media firms to tackle issues such as online extremism and cyberbullying, which are said to affect millions of young Britons every year.
The Times reported last week that the Home Secretary Theresa May had suggested that new surveillance powers - unveiled under the Investigatory Powers Bill - could be used to help police to unmask anonymous cyberbullies.
In a letter to MP James Cartlidge, seen by the paper, Ms May said: ""Internet connection records would update the capability of law enforcement in a criminal investigation to determine the sender and recipient of a communication.""
This could include ""a malicious message such as those exchanged in cyberbullying"".
Twitter has been criticised for not doing enough to tackle online abuse, and in February, then-chief executive Dick Costolo admitted the company ""sucks"" at dealing with trolling.
In its update, however, the firm said it had introduced a range of new protections in 2015, including new tools for reporting abusive behaviour and a ban on the ""promotion of terrorism"".
A spokesperson for the NSPCC, a child protection charity, said Twitter's new rules were ""a long overdue but very welcome step"".
""We have been urging social media companies to take decisive action to curb cyberbullying, which damages the lives of many children who tell us it is almost impossible to find a safe haven from it.
""Industry is now waking-up to this pernicious behaviour and it's good to some are taking a more proactive approach to dealing with it.""",Twitter has updated its rules to highlight it is taking a tougher stance against abuse.
354,"The event, entitled Shifting the Curve - Sharing the Challenge, is aimed at addressing the relatively static rates of breastfeeding in Scotland over the last decade.
Figures show 48.4% of babies were breastfed at around ten days old in 2013/14, compared with 44.4% in 2004/05.
The data shows a trend towards babies being fed both breast and formula milk, as well as a decline in breastfeeding by the six to eight week stage.
Experts in the field will come together to share the latest evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding, review what is working well and identify ways to drive up rates.
A key focus will be on increasing rates of breastfeeding in the most deprived areas in order to help reduce health inequalities.
Mothers in the wealthiest areas are nearly three times as likely to exclusively breastfeed at six to eight weeks, compared with those in the most deprived areas.
Public health minister Maureen Watt said: ""Breastfeeding has major health benefits, in the short and longer term, for both mother and baby. That is why the Scottish Government continues to promote it as the best source of nutrition for babies.
""We know it is important to understand the factors which influence a mother's infant feeding decision and develop effective strategies to encourage more women to breastfeed.
""Research shows that women who know about the health benefits of breastfeeding are more likely to start, therefore it's essential that in the antenatal period the health benefits of breastfeeding are discussed and explained to all women.""
Earlier this month, a study by Unicef concluded increasing the time women breastfeed could save the NHS millions of pounds by improving the health of mother and baby.
The summit will be held on 24 February at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.",Encouraging more women to breastfeed their babies will be the focus of a Scottish Government summit in the New Year.
355,"In a speech on Tuesday, Royal College of Physicians president Prof Jane Dacre will warn ministers the issue must be addressed if their policy is to work.
She will highlight research that shows vacant posts are not being filled and gaps in rotas are being seen.
It comes as ministers are locked in a dispute with junior doctors over their plans for improving weekend care.
Last week thousands of medics went on strike over the government's decision to impose a new contract on them, designed to make it cheaper to rota on staff at weekends.
Prof Dacre will raise her own concerns at the RCP's annual conference in Harrogate, saying NHS trusts are struggling to find enough staff to cope with existing demands.
Physicians are doctors who focus on diagnosis and treatment as opposed to surgery. They cover a whole range of areas including stroke and heart disease to the care of the elderly.
Research by the RCP showed last year there were just over 13,000 consultant physicians across the UK - one in four of all consultants.
But four in 10 vacant posts advertised last year went unfilled, while one in five consultants reported gaps in their junior doctor rotas.
Meanwhile, one in 10 consultants say they often have to carry out junior jobs to ensure patients' care is not harmed.
Prof Dacre will tell delegates: ""I feel sorry for NHS trusts, I really do. Across the country, they have created a raft of new posts to meet the rising demands for patient care, only to find that there is no-one to fill them.
""If we have neither enough trainees nor consultants to run the service now, how are we going to implement a safe seven-day service?""
She will go on to set out the case for extra funding, pointing out hospitals are racking up deficits and that funding lags behind other countries such as France and Germany.
""It is time to revisit our national contribution to healthcare,"" she will say.
But a Department of Health spokeswoman pointed out extra money was being invested during this Parliament - Â£8bn more by 2020.
She said this would help ""make sure the right staff and support is available to create a safe NHS seven days a week"".

Dr Richard Burden, senior physiologist at the English Institute of Sport, told the BBC in January that menstrual cycle research in sport was ""limited"".
The new study has been conducted by two London universities.
The Female Athlete Health Group - a collaborative project between St Mary's University and University College London - worked on two surveys, including one of London Marathon competitors.
Of the 1,862 women surveyed, including 90 who were considered elite level, 41.7% said their menstrual cycle affected their performance.
Nearly 44% met the criteria for heavy menstrual bleeding, but only 22.3% had sought help for period problems.
PhD student Georgie Bruinvels, who is leading the study, told BBC Sport: ""We feel like there are many unanswered questions when it comes to periods in sport.
""As a female athlete myself, I can see how much it impacts. So many elite coaches are male and it's hard for them to understand.
""It's this big taboo. I found that awareness is so poor and people don't know anything about it.
""By doing this research, we hope to raise more awareness and to encourage further examination of the subject.""

357,"President Rodrigo Duterte has said he wants to ""walk the extra mile"" to achieve peace, in a conflict which has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since the 1960s. BBC Monitoring's Mark Wilson examines the challenges ahead.
The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) began its armed struggle in the late 1960s. Its aim has been to overthrow the government through guerrilla warfare. The insurgency was established by academic, author and poet Jose Maria Sison.
The CPP's armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), is believed to number around 4,000 fighters, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s during the martial law era.
The NPA has engaged in killings, bombings and hostage-taking across the archipelago, collecting ""revolutionary taxes"" from businesses in the areas it controls.
Both the CPP and NPA were designated foreign terrorist organisations by the US government in 2002.
The rebels strongly oppose the US military presence in the Philippines and have in the past killed American service personnel stationed in the country.
Since the 1980s they have entered into talks with successive governments, but a peace deal has remained elusive.
Mr Duterte wants to end the insurgency and has said he is willing to ""walk the extra mile"" for peace.
He has tried to revive the peace process and has already held two rounds of formal discussions with the rebels since he took office last year.
The president has attempted to win the rebels' trust through a series of confidence-building measures. These include appointing rebel sympathisers to his cabinet, releasing high-ranking rebels from prison and offering land to NPA members if talks succeed.
The rebels have reciprocated by releasing police officers they were holding hostage.
Both sides have also separately declared a series of unilateral ceasefires, but are yet to agree a joint ceasefire deal.
The ceasefires have been marred by the killings of soldiers and rebels.
Government officials accused the CPP of being unable to control its armed wing after four soldiers were killed in an NPA landmine attack in July.
The attack led Mr Duterte to temporarily lift the government ceasefire.
Days later, an NPA rebel was killed in a battle with the military in Surigao del Norte province.
The rebels, who say they will not give up arms even if a deal is reached, have accused the military of using Mr Duterte's drug war as a pretext to mount operations in rebel areas amid the ceasefire.
A real sticking point in recent months has been the issue of freeing around 400 detained rebels.
The CPP demands that the government grant a general amnesty to these rebels as part of negotiations.
After Mr Duterte refused, insisting that the rebels must first agree to a joint ceasefire deal, the rebels accused him of ""capriciously changing his mind"" on the issue.
Since the last round of talks in October, the rebels have also taken issue with some of Mr Duterte's policies at home and abroad.
They have criticised both his warming relations with Russia and China and his move to allow a hero's burial for late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
At the forthcoming talks on 18 January, to be held in Rome, the two sides will aim to reach a bilateral ceasefire deal.
That the talks have got this far demonstrates the desire for peace on both sides, but delays in granting amnesties to detained rebels is threatening to derail negotiations.
Wide ranging rebel-proposed social and economic reforms, which the CPP has described as the core of the talks, are also still to be agreed.",The Philippines government is due to begin peace talks with communist rebels on 18 January which could end one of Asia's longest insurgencies.

359,"Powys council's cabinet said the loss of £1.6m over the next three years has affected the number of classes it could afford and it was launching a review.
It will look at whether its sixth forms are financially viable and educationally sustainable.
The Welsh government said it is working with Powys to minimise the impact of cuts to learning.
The council launched a similar review three years ago but eventually decided not to shut any sixth forms in the county.
Since then, the council has backed the takeover of the struggling John Beddoes School in Presteigne by Newtown High School, meaning the number of sixth forms in the county will drop from 13 to 12 from April.
Council cabinet member for learning Myfanwy Alexander said: ""Changes to the way post-16 funding is delivered and a decline in pupil numbers have had a severe impact on Powys sixth forms.
""Learner choice will be hit hard and the sustainability of Powys sixth forms will be seriously affected.""
In September 2012, the council was able to fund 232 further education classes across the authority area.
But according to the council, the decline in pupil numbers and changes to post-16 education budgets means only 181 classes will be funded in September 2014.
Ms Alexander said she feared a ""reduced menu of subjects"" for pupils, leading to some students travelling outside of Powys to study.
She said the education authority had made ""strong representations"" to the Welsh government on the funding changes, and had asked for a rethink on funding levels or risk ""damaging changes in Powys"".
Responding to the council's comments, the Welsh government's deputy minister for skills and technology Ken Skates said: ""We have been open about the stark reality of the financial challenges ahead and the difficult decisions that we are facing.
""The post-16 sector remains a key priority for this government and we are working closely with colleagues in Powys and across Wales to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning.""
Controversial plans to save around £20m was approved by councillors in Powys last week. The decision also means about 400 posts will be lost at the authority.",Some secondary school sixth forms in Powys could be at risk following a 10% cut in post-16 education funding.
360,"Brent crude ended Thursday 0.4% higher at $49.94 a barrel.
Prices initially fell but then reversed course when figures showed that US crude stockpiles had fallen in the past week.
In a statement, Opec said its members were committed to a ""stable and balanced oil market"".
Speaking after the meeting, Saudi Arabia pledged that it would not flood the market by increasing production.
The country's energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said: ""We will be very gentle in our approach and make sure we don't shock the market in anyway.""
Opec members produce 40% of the world's crude oil.
A meeting of most Opec members, along with other oil exporters including Russia, similarly failed to cap output following a meeting in Qatar in April.
John Hall, an oil analyst with alfaenergy, said: ""Now that there is a realisation that Opec will not be restricting output, traders are caught long with too much oil in a falling market and so once $50 had been reached, there was a general mood to sell off rapidly.""
After peaking at about $115 a barrel in the summer of 2014, the price of oil fell steadily to a low of about $27 in January this year due to a combination of weaker demand and increased supply.
Opec secretary-general Abdulla al-Badri denied that the failure to cap output meant that the cartel was dead: ""Opec will be powerful, will be strong. Opec is alive.""
Bob Minter, analyst at Aberdeen Asset Management Investment, said: ""This should have been an easy meeting to re-establish Opec relevance, but they missed the opportunity.""
The oil ministers did agree that Nigeria's Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo would become Opec's new secretary-general from 1 August.
The decision ended years of dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which had put forward their own candidates and refused to agree on a compromise.
The ministers also agreed to admit Gabon as the 14th member of Opec from next month.",The price of oil rose slightly despite a meeting of the Opec oil producers' group failing to set a cap on the amount of oil the group produces.
361,"With the game pointless, England hooker Hartley lashed out at Tigers' Matt Smith with just 17 minutes gone.
Tigers registered a penalty try, but after the break Alex Waller and Ben Foden went over for the champions and Niki Goneva scored two of his own.
But with three minutes left Jamie Elliott touched down to win an epic derby at Franklin's Gardens.
It was all in spite of Saints captain Hartley's indiscretion, the latest on a growing rap sheet throughout his career which will raise questions about his credentials to represent England, regardless of whether his inevitable ban stretches into next year's Six Nations.
With two separate brawls having broken out on the pitch, replays showed that Hartley's elbow connected with Smith's chin during a scuffle, and referee JP Doyle took the advice of the television match official to send off the 28-year-old.
After missing last year's British & Irish Lions tour of Australia with an 11-week ban after being dismissed for swearing at referee Wayne Barnes in the 2013 Premiership final - also against the Tigers - Hartley, by his own admission, was in the last chance saloon when it came to his England career.
The New Zealand-born forward, who rejected a big-money move to Montpellier to sign a new Saints deal this week, can also count a 26-week ban in 2007 for eye gouging and eight-week and two-week bans in 2012, for biting and striking respectively, among his misdemeanours.
With just 17 minutes having passed when he trudged off the field, Saints, like in the 2013 final, were once again without their captain and facing an uphill battle.
Immediately after Hartley's sending off, which inevitably overshadowed a typically ferocious East Midlands derby, things got worse for Saints who, still trying to regroup, conceded a penalty try for impeding three consecutive scrums.
Owen Williams slotted the conversion and Stephen Myler put over a penalty for Saints, before Tigers' Tom Croft was sin-binned moments before the break for a high tackle.
Myler collected the points off the tee and after the interval Saints capitalised on Croft's absence, pinning Tigers back into their 22 and freeing up Salesi Ma'afu to pass on to Waller for the score.
Tom Youngs, who may be eyeing up Hartley's place in Stuart Lancaster's England side, lasted less than 50 minutes as he continued his return from injury, but Tigers were able to reassert themselves when they were back up to their full quota.
Replacement Freddie Burns's break down the middle had Saints scrambling under their posts and Leicester quickly recycled as Goneva crossed after taking a pass from Williams, who skewed his conversion wide.
Fourteen-man Saints once again validated their status as champions and Premiership leaders, though, when Luther Burrell, who was a powerhouse all afternoon, burst forward, allowing the ball to go through the hands to Foden for a superb finish from 35 metres.
It looked like it might be to no avail as Tigers, unbeaten in four Premiership games coming into the match, turned it over in midfield through Julian Salvi and put Goneva over in the corner.
But, remarkably, Saints found time for one more push and, from a line-out, swept the ball across the pitch for Elliott to clinch an unlikely and thrilling victory.

""At half-time Tom Wood said 'let's do it for Dylan'.
""It was a tremendous, spirited performance. Not just relying on spirit and guts but also a lot of technical and tactical work.
""In terms of the red card it is disappointing. Dylan has to keep his arms down but he's being held and I don't think there is any malice in it. The nature of the game didn't justify a red card. I think Smith went down pretty easily, which was disappointing.
""I think the referee's initial decision of a yellow card would have been the correct decision.

362,"The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI) stood at 52.6, down from August's 52.9, but above the 50 level which indicates expansion.
On Monday, the manufacturing sector recorded its best PMI for two years.
Markit said the latest findings cast doubt on the need for more stimulus action from the Bank of England.
The surveys, which are calculated by speaking to purchasing professionals and business decision-makers across a range of companies, are seen as an early indication of how the economy is performing, since they are released before official GDP data.
""The survey results suggest that the economy has regained modest growth momentum since the EU referendum, with especially strong growth appearing in manufacturing,"" said Markit's chief business economist Chris Williamson.
""The risk of recession in the second half of 2016 has therefore all but evaporated, and the solid PMI readings for September will cast doubt on the need for any further stimulus from the Bank of England in coming months.""
July's survey had shown a steep drop in business activity in the immediate wake of the referendum, but that started to recover in August. In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.
However, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, ""reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit"".
Official growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.
Pantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, ""as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation"".
The PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.
The services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy.","The UK services sector continued to recover last month, after a sharp drop in activity following the Brexit vote, according to a closely watched survey."

On Monday, Universities Wales will publish its manifesto ahead of next year's Assembly elections calling for the current tuition fee grant to be replaced by a means tested grant.
The Welsh government said its policy was an ""investment in young people"".
University Wales's chairman Prof Colin Riordan said means testing would be fairer.
He told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme: ""You could decide to spend the resource equally and thinly or you can say 'let's focus on the areas of most need' - so those people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, perhaps, or areas which need support such as expensive subjects"".
Universities have long argued the grant means tens of millions of pounds leaves the higher education sector in Wales and goes to the coffers of their counterparts in England.
Prof Riordan added: ""Means testing would mean that those students who really need support would get it.
""Those who are more able to support themselves would be able to do that. That's surely fair.""
Earlier this month the UK government's Universities Minister Jo Johnson said institutions in England would be allowed to raise their fees in future if they can demonstrate a high quality of teaching.
But Prof Riordan said it ""would add cost to the tuition fee grant in ways that could become quite unsustainable"".
The tuition fee grant has faced criticism from many involved with Higher Education in Wales.
Earlier this year, the head of the body responsible for allocating funding to universities in Wales said the Welsh government needs to change how it funds students from Wales to avoid universities here falling behind their English counterparts.
In 2013, BBC Wales revealed the body representing universities here had concerns they were losing out compared to their counterparts in England because of the tuition fee grant.
BBC Wales has also revealed concerns expressed by the finance directors of universities in Wales that the grant left the sector ""with an uncertain financial future"".
In November 2013, the Welsh government announced a review of higher education funding and student finance arrangements in Wales, which is chaired by the Scottish academic, Professor Ian Diamond.
Prof Diamond will make some of his thoughts public later this year, with the full review expected to be published after the Assembly elections in May next year.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Our tuition fee policy is an investment in young people.
""Over the course of a three year undergraduate degree, current students from Wales are around Â£17,000 better off than their English counterparts.
""The Diamond review of higher education and student finance in Wales is ongoing. Once published, it will inform the next steps for higher education funding in Wales.""","The way Welsh students are funded is unsustainable, the body representing universities in Wales has said."

366,"In an emergency statement at Holyrood, he apologised to rail passengers who have been affected by disruption.
It came on the day commuters faced severe disruption after overhead wiring problems affected services in Glasgow.
ScotRail declared a major incident after finding a broken insulator between Partick and Glasgow Central.
The rail operator said the issue caused disruption and cancellations between Glasgow Central and Dalmuir, Milngavie and Maryhill.
There has been widespread criticism of the reliability of ScotRail trains since Abellio took over the franchise.
Abellio has said the terms of the contract meant government ministers were responsible for overcrowding on the network.
In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Yousaf admitted that ScotRail's performance was not ""up to scratch"" but he said it was higher than the UK average.
He also outlined a series of actions and investments Scotrail will make.
They include an earlier commuter service between Inverness and the central belt, which will begin in mid-December, and the addition of carriages to peak services on the Borders Railway in a bid to reduce overcrowding.
The minister said: ""Everyone rightly expects a railway network that operates effectively. So when things go wrong I fully understand the dissatisfaction of passengers and the inconvenience that is caused.
""Although there are no guarantees major failures won't happen, I give my reassurance that ScotRail has learned lessons and is far better prepared for contingencies, including communication with passengers, when such incidents do take place.""
He added: ""I know about the work that is required and the service that is to be delivered. I am taking action and a plan is now in place. This government has a track record of delivering for our railways and it is my firm intention that we will continue to do so.""
In his statement, Mr Yousaf also highlighted:
ScotRail was ordered to produce a performance improvement plan in September after punctuality and reliability fell below the expected standard.
At Holyrood, the minister faced calls to publish the plan in full from Liberal Democrat Mike Rumbles.
Mr Yousaf agreed to speak to ScotRail about its publication in the interests of ""accountability and transparency"".
Scottish Labour's transport spokesman Neil Bibby said the rail service has become worse since the improvement plan was demanded.
He added: ""His handling of the rail crisis has seen him fall out with Abellio, Network Rail and the transport unions.
""Humza Yousaf claims he's not a transport expert - and he's right. Humza Yousaf must ditch the spin and publish his 246 point improvement plan in full.""
Murdo Fraser, of the Scottish Conservatives, said it was time the government started taking responsibility for the railways' poor performance.
The latest performance data showed 86% of ScotRail trains were on time or less than five minutes late between 16 October and 12 November, with wide variations in reliability across the country.
ScotRail's figures remained better than the average for all UK train operators - with the company also enjoying better than average customer satisfaction figures when the latest data was published earlier this year.
But Abellio's contract to run the ScotRail franchise requires the company to ensure 91.3% of trains arrive within five minutes of schedule.
The Scottish government can cancel the contract if performance drops to 84.3% for three months in a row.","Transport Minister Humza Yousaf has told MSPs that ""ScotRail has learned lessons"" following a series of problems on Scotland's railways."

After crawling for three-quarters of a mile (1.2km), he was found by his wife who had become concerned for his welfare.
A coastguard statement said it was ""quite an ordeal"" for Mr Robinson.
The coastguard said Mr Robinson had been walking on rocks on the western end of the beach at about 16:30 GMT when he slipped and injured his leg.
With no means of calling for help, he dragged himself off the rocks back on to the beach and then crawled in the darkness towards Seatown.
He was eventually discovered by his wife who had gone to look for him and she raised the alarm. The couple, from the Derby area, were on holiday in Bridport.
The coastguard rescue team saw ""faint torch lights"" on the beach and crew from an RNLI lifeboat swam ashore to reach Mr Robinson.
With a rescue helicopter unavailable due to fog, he was transferred on to the lifeboat and taken to Lyme Regis from where he was taken by ambulance to hospital in Dorchester.
Mr Robinson, who is a full-time member of the Territorial Army, said: ""I just slipped on a rock and have two fractures of the right leg. Everyone who helped me was just terrific.""
RNLI helmsman Jon Broome said: ""His military background came to the fore. He found some sticks and used them to get to the beach. He then crawled on his hands and knees for a good two hours.

The federal statistics office retained its growth forecast for the year ending in March 2017 at 7.1%.
The figures surprised economists, who had expected the economy to take a bigger hit from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision last November to withdraw old 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee banknotes, taking 86% of the currency out of circulation virtually overnight.

Selby's IBF featherweight world title defence against Jonathan Victor Barros in Las Vegas was called off on Friday.
The Welshman has said Carl Frampton and Abner Mares, the regular WBA champion, could be future opponents.
""Selby's not really had that one big fight which can make him that name,"" Khan told BBC Wales Sport.
""I think beating someone like Abner Mares or someone like [Leo] Santa Cruz or Frampton would definitely take him to a different level.
""They're big names in the world of boxing and [some] have titles so, definitely by beating one of those big names, Selby would be right up there.
""I think Selby has the talent to do it. He's a prospect to keep an eye on in the future.""
Selby's third defence of his IBF world title was meant to take place on the undercard of Frampton's WBA featherweight title bout with Mexico's Leo Santa Cruz at the MGM Grand.
If he had beaten Barros, Selby was planning to challenge Frampton - with the Northern Irishman saying he would like the fight to take place at Belfast's Windsor Park.

The abandonment of Selby's fight against Barros could delay those plans but, whenever it may happen, it is a fight Khan would like to see materialise.

373,"NHS Health Scotland found that a ban on multi-buy drinks promotions was among a number of successful initiatives.
However, it warned that more needed to be done to ensure the improvements continued, including the introduction of a minimum price for alcohol.
The report is the final review of the Scottish government's alcohol strategy, which was introduced in 2009.
Before then, high and increasing levels of alcohol consumption were closely linked to increasing alcohol harm.
Studies had shown that alcohol may have caused the deaths of one in 20 of the Scots who died in 2003.
And half of Scotland's prisoners said they were drunk when they committed their offence.
The government's ""framework for action"" outlined 41 steps to reduce alcohol consumption, and support families and communities.
A key policy - a minimum price for alcohol - has not been introduced because it is subject to a legal challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association.
Clare Beeston, from NHS Health Scotland, said the country continued to ""pay a heavy price"" for high levels of alcohol consumption.
She added: ""The picture has improved but levels of alcohol-related harm remain high - on average 22 people in Scotland die every week because of alcohol.""
She warned that the decline in alcohol consumption and harm may have slowed or stalled recently.
""We need to continue to push for the most effective ways to reduce the amount of alcohol Scotland drinks,"" she said.
""These are to reduce the affordability, availability and promotion of alcohol.
""A minimum unit price for alcohol is one of the best ways to reduce drinking in the heaviest drinkers and tackle the alcohol related health inequalities.""
The report highlighted the success of several parts of the strategy:
It also found that external factors, such as a fall in disposable income, were likely to have had an impact on alcohol trends.
Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said:  ""We have seen reductions in alcohol-related harm and this is of course welcome.
""However, harm rates are still higher than they were 20 years ago and higher than in England and Wales, so now is not the time to be complacent.""
She added: ""The report also recognises that a key element of the alcohol framework - minimum unit pricing - has yet to be implemented due to a legal challenge from parts of the alcohol industry and this has impacted on the progress made.
""Given the link between consumption and harm, and evidence that affordability is a key driver of increased consumption, addressing price is an important element of any long-term strategy to tackle alcohol misuse and, as such, we remain committed to introducing minimum unit pricing.""",A new report has found that government policies have had a positive impact on alcohol consumption in Scotland.
374,"Charlotte Foster, from Telford, died in January after a thrombosis caused a ""massive"" embolism in her lungs.
A GP who saw her three weeks before noted no signs of thrombosis.
Miss Foster's mother told the coroner the GP thought the problem was ""mechanical"" and recommended a massage.
The 23 year old died in hospital three days after collapsing at her workplace.
Celia Foster told the inquest at Shropshire Coroner's Court, her daughter had heart palpitations and had messaged her family on New Year's Eve to say her ribs hurt and that she could not lie down or breathe properly.
She said she accompanied her daughter to an appointment with GP Sunil Simon at his practice in Newport on 4 January.
She said her daughter was angry after the consultation, as he ""did not seem to listen to her"" and suggested she go for a massage or a spa day, despite her complaining of leg and back pain and tightness in her chest.
In his evidence to the hearing, Dr Simon said he had ""no concerns"" during the appointment that Miss Foster had been suffering from a pulmonary embolism.
""When I observed Miss Foster during that day, I did not note any signs of respiratory distress or shortness of breath. She did not display any signs of a pulmonary embolism of a deep vein thrombosis,"" he said.
Miss Foster went into cardiac arrest at work and died at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital on 25 January.
She had been given a three-month prescription of Dianette as a contraceptive and to combat acne in August 2015, having advised her GP of a family history of pulmonary embolism and breast cancer.
She then returned to see a different GP at her surgery in Newport in October and was given a continuing prescription for the drug, having reported no side effects.
Dr Nigel Tuft, a consultant at the Princess Royal Hospital, told the hearing that CT scans had shown she was not suffering from any tumours likely to have caused the pulmonary embolism.
He said he had multiple discussions with her family following her death, and had concluded her only risk factor was that she was taking the oral contraceptive.
Dr Tuft told the inquest: ""The most likely site for the pulmonary embolism to arise is in the veins of the pelvis and the upper leg. These can cause no symptoms whatsoever or they can cause symptoms or deep vein thrombosis.""

Kurdish military sources in north-eastern Syria told me that Mr Scurfield was killed when the armoured vehicle he was in was hit by a missile launched by the Islamic State militants.
The special mobile guerrilla unit which Mr Scurfield was part of came under attack during an offensive against IS to recapture areas around Til Hamis town in Hasakah province.
Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) forces have recovered his body along with other casualties, and brought the body to Derik, a town in north-eastern corner of Syria, close to Iraqi border.
He joined the YPG, a secular group that has proven to be very effective against IS in Syria and Iraq, on 7 December. The Kurdish sources say that in a video, which is not publicly available yet, Mr Scurfield says he ""joined the YPG to fight against IS"".
Mr Jarvis, who is Labour MP for Barnsley Central, called on the government to monitor all British citizens who travel to Iraq and Syria to join the fight against IS.
""There have been several reports of other British civilians doing the same thing, but the government confirmed when I recently raised this issue in Parliament that there is currently no system to monitor or record people going to the region with the aim of joining the fight against Isis,"" he said.
""I wrote to the Foreign Office regarding this issue some weeks ago and will be now following up that letter.""
In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended.
""As we do not have any representation in Syria it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.""

The victim, Alexander Hurley, had come to Jonathan Dowdall's Dublin home to buy a motorcycle in January 2015 when he was tortured.
The attack was filmed on a mobile phone and played in court.
Mr Hurley was filmed tied to a chair in the Dowdalls' garage as Jonathan Dowdall, who was wearing a balaclava, put a tea towel on his face and poured buckets of water over him.
Patrick Dowdall took out pliers and threatened to pull off the victim's fingers, starting with the smallest.

He said it would counteract the Army School of the Americas in Georgia which trained US allies during the Cold War.
Some of its graduates committed serious human rights abuses in the region.
The new academy is based in the city of Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia and will initially take 100 recruits.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Bolivia's Defence Minister Reymi Ferreira said: ""The School of Anti-Imperialism is a school that seeks to preserve life, unlike the School of the Americas, which brainwashed military officers into believing that the enemy was our people.""
He said the training centre would seek to help soldiers identify key threats to the country's national sovereignty.
Since his inauguration in 2005, President Morales has had a relationship with the US which has been at times very tense.
In 2008 he expelled the US ambassador and counter-narcotics agent and more recently he has accused accusing Washington of encouraging ""congressional coups"" such as the impending impeachment trial of suspended President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil.
He has also accused the US of promoting global terrorism through military interventions, citing the rise of the Islamic State group as an example.
In Latin America, some officers trained at the US-based School of the Americas went on to commit some of the worse human rights abuses in the region.
They include two of the Argentinean military officers who led the junta in the late 1970s.  Human rights organisations say the military government killed around 30,000 left-wing opponents during their administration.
The former Guatemalan President, General Efraim Rios Montt, also trained at  the School of the Americas in the 1950s.

It was part of a much wider system, he said, where pupils are rewarded with points which they can use to buy items.
But some parents accused the school of humiliating or bullying pupils.
Mr Tutt, who took over the secondary modern four years ago, said his students were rewarded far more than they were punished.
""This needs to be taken in a far wider context. We have a very well established behaviour sanction and reward system,"" he said, adding that behaviour was impeccable at the academy.
This included an online reward system, where students received points for good behaviour, which could be used to buy things like nail manicures or footballs.
Pupils at the school, 40% of whom are classed as disadvantaged, are also rewarded with free coffees or by being allowed to go to the front of the lunch queue, Mr Tutt said, as well as usual status positions, such as being made prefects.
One Facebook post, from Jodi Taylor, said: ""My god-daughter goes to this school and this is just a few of the things they threaten.
""She is frightened to go to school and she is a good girl. It is nothing short of bullying, the good kids are being treated as bad and been threatened on a daily basis.
""School is meant to be a fun part of growing up?""
A parent, also writing on Facebook, said that the idea was an ""absolute disgrace"", adding: ""My boys go to this school. If they try that with my boys I will seek legal action.""
Mr Tutt said the assembly apology sanction was reserved for extreme cases and had not yet been used.
""It is to deal with repeat offenders who have received fixed term exclusions. The type of behaviour being punished might include being in complete defiance of a teacher or physical violence.

He said there had been a very small minority of parents who did not sign up to the idea.
A letter to parents said: ""Any student whose behaviour disrupts the learning of others will be expected to stand up at the front in their faculty assembly, face their peers, and apologise to the whole faculty for letting them down.

""This will help students, whose poor behaviour has caused them to be excluded, settle back into lessons and academy life.""
Mr Tutt said students at risk of being excluded were offered a range of support and given pastoral care, because the school did everything it could to avoid permanent exclusions.

The survey indicates a drop in support for Labour and Sinn Féin, with Fianna Fáil and Independents improving their position.
The figures would mean an indecisive result if it was replicated on polling day.
The poll shows no change in Fine Gael support since the election campaign began and a drop in Labour Party support to just 6%.
Fianna Fáil has moved up two percentage points to 23%, Sinn Féin is down four points to 15%, according to the poll.
There appear to be significant gains for independents and smaller parties, who are up three points to 28%.

""The crew of the ship acted provocatively and aggressively, which concerned the operators of monitoring stations and ships of the Black Sea Fleet,"" according to a military source quoted by Russian state media.
""Su-24 attack aircraft demonstrated to the American crew readiness to harshly prevent a violation of the frontier and to defend the interests of the country.""

388,"The team's technique involves building a 3D image of a patient's brain in a matter of minutes.
Strokes occur about 152,000 times a year in the UK, according to the Stroke Association.
In Scotland, NHS Scotland considers strokes to be the third commonest cause of death.
When a stroke happens speed is of the essence. First in diagnosing what kind of stroke it is, then treating it.
That is because there are two main types - ischemic and haemorrhagic - and two very different ways of treating them.
Both MRI and CT scanners can provide an image of the brain and the damage done, but are big and expensive. Patients have to come to them.
The mathematicians envisage a new type of detector small enough to ride in an ambulance.
It will be a helmet containing microwave antennae, and will fire the microwave through the patient's brain and receive the resulting signals.
The results will be sent to a supercomputing centre, which is where the maths comes in.
The techniques developed at Strathclyde and on the continent can produce a 3D image of the brain - and its injury - within 15 minutes.
The sensor hardware is being developed by the Austrian imaging company EMTensor.
At the moment it exists as two prototypes in a hospital in Vienna.
Each is a cylindrical chamber consisting of five rings, each of 32 antennae.
The next step will be to make the device portable.
One of the mathematics team is Dr Victorita Dolean, a Reader in Strathclyde's Department of Mathematics and Statistics.
""Our aim will be to produce a portable and less expensive device that can detect strokes in real time,"" she says.
""The idea would be that we'd send these electromagnetic waves into the brain and then the properties of the tissues - which will be healthy or sick - will be detected by measurements of the data on this helmet.
""The data will be sent to a supercomputing centre.
""We have designed some open source software that is able to reconstruct, precisely and in real time, an image of the brain and then send it back to the doctors to interpret this data and make the diagnosis.""
The team's mathematical approach has already won the team the Bull-Joseph Fourier Prize for excellence in numerical simulation and data processing.
""We could not have done this a few years ago because we needed powerful advances in electronics, in computer science, in algorithms, in mathematics,"" Dr Dolean says.
She now expects the sensor helmets to be in the field in two to four years - not just in ambulances, but anywhere they might be needed.
""They'll be cheap and portable and able to act as an emergency device,"" she says.
And that quick, on the spot diagnosis could mean survival for stroke victims.","An international team of mathematicians, including one from Strathclyde University, has developed a method to speed up stroke diagnosis."

390,"The Welsh government is more than halfway through a £4.6m five-year programme to immunise badgers in north Pembrokeshire.
Infection rates have fallen across Wales, but Christianne Glossop said it was too early to say whether it has had ""additional benefit"".
Dr Glossop was speaking ahead of a worldwide conference on TB control.
It will be held in Cardiff on Monday.
""The programme is for five years,"" she told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales.
""We've completed two years and we're now well into year three, and so the results are by no means available yet.""
TB infection rates fell across Wales over the last 12 months, she said.
""The reduction in north Pembrokeshire is in line with the national reduction, so right now, we have no evidence that the vaccination programme in badgers is delivering an additional benefit - and we wouldn't expect to see any evidence at this stage either,"" she said.
In 2012 and 2013, 2,776 badgers were trapped and vaccinated in the Intensive Action Area (IAA), which also takes in parts of Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, at a cost of more than £1.8m.
But Dr Glossop said that the wider TB eradication programme cost £28m last year alone, most of which was spent on testing cattle, biosecurity and compensating farmers.
""You've always got to have the balance here between all the different elements of the programme, making sure that you're tackling all sources of infection,"" she said.
The vaccination programme was announced by Labour ministers in 2012 when they abandoned the previous coalition government's intention to cull badgers in the IAA.","It is unclear whether vaccinating badgers in west Wales has cut TB in cattle, the chief vet has said."

The real legacy he [Johnson] will leave is the systems and structures he has helped to develop that will allow us to continue leading the way in Wales
Johnson's role with Scotland is thought to also include some involvement with Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Ospreys chief operations officer Andrew Hore said: ""It is a huge disappointment for us to be losing Scott at the end of the season, but we understand that he feels it is the right time for him to move on to other challenges having served the three years he committed himself to us for originally.""
Hore added: ""By informing us of his intentions at this early stage, it allows us to use this time to consider our next course of action and the options available to us as we plan for the future.""
Managing director Roger Blyth said: ""While he has brought silverware to the Liberty Stadium and we hope that will be the case once again this season, the real legacy he will leave is the systems and structures he has helped to develop that will allow us to continue leading the way in Wales.""
Johnson joined the Ospreys ahead of the 2009-10 season, leaving the role of USA Eagles national coach to do so.
He first arrived in Wales as a skills coach during 2011 World Cup winning coach Graham Henry's reign and was assistant coach during the Steve Hansen and Mike Ruddock eras.
Wales won their first Grand Slam in 27 years under Ruddock in 2005 and many credited Johnson with playing a key role in that achievement.
Johnson became Wales caretaker coach during the 2006 Six Nations following Ruddock's controversial departure.
In March 2006 Johnson became one of John Connolly's assistant coaches and selectors ahead of the Wallabies' 2007 World Cup campaign.
In 2008 he became USA coach and left the following year to return to Wales with the Ospreys.
During his time at the Liberty Stadium, they reached the 2009-10 Heineken Cup quarter-finals where they were defeated 29-28 by Biarritz.
A year later they bowed out after a tough pool stage featuring Munster, Toulon and London Irish and this term are struggling in the competition having drawn 26-26 in Treviso and lost back-to-back games against Saracens in Pool Five.
In what was the Magners League, the Ospreys' greatest triumph came in Johnson's first Ospreys term, a 17-12 win over Leinster in Dublin in the tournament's inaugural Grand Final.
Ahead of the 2011-12 season they lost high-profile players James Hook, Lee Byrne, Jerry Collins, Marty Holah and Mike Phillips and were without a glut of Test stars playing for Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Samoa at the World Cup.
But after a strong start in what is now the Pro12 League, the Ospreys lie second to Leinster with eight wins from 11 games.
Wasps coach Dai Young and Johnson coached the Barbarians when they beat Wales in June, 2011.
Johnson was Wales' observer of Sir Clive Woodward's British and Irish Lions back-room staff during the ill-fated 2005 tour to New Zealand.
Scotland coach Robinson was a Woodward assistant on that tour and has sought someone of the right calibre to be his right-hand man.
""I am delighted Scott has agreed to join the Scotland coaching team. I have huge respect for him as a coach and a person having coached against him on numerous occasions,"" Robinson said.

Hamilton faces a race of damage limitation to his title hopes, as Rosberg, who is nine points ahead in the championship, is likely to run away in the lead, such is the level of Mercedes' dominance around the demanding new 3.7-mile street track in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku.
""P10 is going to be horrible as it always is around street circuits,"" Hamilton said.

Hamilton said: ""All my tyres are flat-spotted so I have no idea what they are going to do.""
However, he said he was optimistic he could still have a good race.
""If I don't get caught up in other people's mistakes, good points are still possible. It's not impossible I could win.""

He blamed a ""lack of interest"" and little understanding of the role.
However, others believe criticism of the douzaine over the appointment of a town centre manager may be behind the lack of volunteers for the unpaid position.
Shane Langlois, chairman of the Douzaine Council, said: ""Obviously there's been a lot of controversy over the town centre manager, but that's just guesswork.""
He said another possible reason for a lack of interest from parishioners was because the parish system was confusing, although the picture around the rest of the island was more encouraging.
Mr Langlois said: ""There are far more contested elections than I've ever seen... it's very unusual and encouraging. There's normally not more than one or two.""
He has called for an end to electors' meetings where elections are uncontested - as currently parishioners can vote for ballots to take place - describing them as unnecessary.

398,"Sir Philip had put a ""substantial"" recovery plan in place to resolve the deficit in pension schemes at Top Shop owner Arcadia, Mr Field said.
However, the original fix for the BHS scheme had been ""inadequate"", he said.
Sir Philip owned BHS for 15 years before selling it in March 2015.
It was bought for £1 by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt with little experience in retailing, and went into administration a year later.
There followed a lengthy and often rancorous investigation by the Work and Pensions Committee into the handling of the BHS pension fund.
Sir Philip promised to ""sort"" the problem and after months of negotiations with the Pensions Regulator, he agreed, in February, to pay £363m to bolster the BHS scheme.
The Work and Pensions Committee also sought information about the pension schemes of Arcadia, the owner of Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, and controlled by Sir Philip.
Over the weekend, documents published by the committee showed that Arcadia had a deficit in its pension schemes of almost £565m in March 2016.
That is up from almost £456m, when the previous assessment was made in March 2013.
To address that shortfall Arcadia has doubled its annual contribution to the two main funds to £50m.
""This is a credible plan for tackling a giant deficit and great news for Arcadia pensioners who must have been concerned,"" said Mr Field.
""It is though clear from these figures that Sir Philip was long favouring the Arcadia schemes over their BHS counterparts, which have more members,"" he said.
In 2012, while BHS was under the ownership of Sir Philip, a 23-year plan to fix the pension deficit was agreed.
Mr Field described that plan as ""ludicrous"" and contrasted it with a 13-year recovery plan for Arcadia pension schemes, which included much bigger contributions to cover the deficit.
""I imagine Sir Philip would say that Arcadia could afford it because it was profitable, whereas BHS was not,"" Mr Field said.

401,"Scientists believe kissing helps people judge the quality of a potential mate through taste, smell and fitness.
Once in a relationship, the Oxford University study found kissing was a way of getting a partner to stick around.
Women were found to value kissing more highly in long-term relationships.
An online survey of 900 adults by the Oxford team, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, showed that men and women who were more attractive or had more casual sex partners were more selective in choosing mates, and those groups valued kissing more highly.
This suggests that kissing helps in sizing up a potential partner, the study says.
Professor Robin Dunbar, from the department of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said courtship in humans was complex and involved a whole series of assessments before men and women decided to carry on their relationship.
""Initial attraction may include facial, body and social cues. Then assessments become more and more intimate as we go deeper into the courtship stages, and this is where kissing comes in.
""In choosing partners, we have to deal with the 'Jane Austen problem': How long do you wait for Mr Darcy to come along when you can't wait forever and there may be lots of you waiting just for him? At what point do you have to compromise for the curate?""
Prof Dunbar said that Jane Austen, whose works of romantic fiction included Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, realised that people were extremely good at assessing where they were in the ""mating market"" and pitching their demands accordingly.
""It depends what kind of poker hand you've been dealt.
""If you have a strong bidding hand, you can afford to be much more demanding and choosy when it comes to prospective mates,"" he said,
If kissing plays a part in selecting a partner then it also plays an important role before sex in short relationships and at a range of different times in committed relationships, the study found.
The study found that kissing was particularly important to women in long-term relationships.
This may be because it plays a role in increasing feelings of affection and attachment among couples, the researchers suggest.
Previous research had found that women placed greater value on activities that strengthen long-term relationships because being pregnant and raising children is easier when two parents are present.
In another study in Human Nature, researchers from Oxford suggest that women's attitude to romantic kissing also depends on where in their menstrual cycle and their relationship they are.
Women valued kissing most at the start of a relationship and around the time they were most likely to conceive in their cycle.","Kissing helps us assess potential partners if, like a Jane Austen heroine, we cannot wait forever for Mr Darcy to come along, a study suggests."

Entrants in the three-day event were judged on ""sustained volume"" from a 20m (65ft) distance, diction and bearing among other things.
Mr Wylie, who almost lost his voice in the effort, said: ""I decided to give it my all and my all is what it took.""
Having been Calne's town crier since 2007, Mr Wylie normally dons a heavy, ""made-to-fit"" uniform in the colours of the town's flag.
But to compete in the tropical heat, a special lightweight cotton outfit had to be made.
""My normal regalia is 100% wool and I would have melted in that,"" he said.
""So my wife made me a new set which was the right weight and very comfortable to wear.""
Held over three days with a different cry staged each day, Mr Wylie managed to oust the reigning world champion - Canadian Chris Whyman - by winning all three.
""My voice is better than it was but it's still rough,"" he said.
""Some criers seem to be able to bellow for as long as they like and it doesn't affect them at all.  I'm not too bad usually but in the final round, I could feel it was already pretty hoarse.""
Despite almost losing his voice in the final stages of the competition, the Wiltshire crier not only took the championship trophy but the winner's reward as well.

404,"The electrostatic coating allows the netting to carry much higher doses of insecticide.
In experiments, the coating killed off many more mosquitoes than usual.
Dutch researchers, writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say this could help control diseases such as malaria.
Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes has become a significant problem in many parts of the world where malaria is endemic.
It is thought that water-based spray insecticides and bed nets, which often contain low levels of insecticide, don't always kill the mosquitoes, allowing them to develop resistance.
In this study, researchers from the Netherlands used a charged surface, originally developed for trapping airborne pollen, and applied insecticide to it.
The long-lasting electrostatic charge allowed high levels of insecticide to stick fast to the netting, giving the mosquitoes a lethal overdose when they came into contact with the surface - even for just a few seconds.
The technique was tested on different strains of mosquito in South Africa, Tanzania and at a lab at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.
The research team found that the electrostatic coating of insecticide killed more mosquitoes than other nettings and, for certain insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, was 100% effective.
Conventional nettings kill fewer than 10% of mosquitoes, the study said.
Marit Farenhorst, who led the research, from In2Care at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, said the coating could be used on screens on windows and doors around the home, on curtains and walls, and in mosquito traps and wall ventilation tubes in homes.
""It's a new way of trying to target and contaminate mosquitoes,"" she said.
She also said the new method would be suitable for a number of different types of chemical insecticide.
However, she said the coating was probably not suitable for bed nets because people regularly touch and wash them so the insecticide would come off over time.","A new method of applying insecticide to netting has proved 100% effective against some strains of mosquito, an international study reports."
405,"It could see Spotify register shares on a stock exchange and become a publicly listed company without raising new cash, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Shares would be traded on the day of listing, with the price based on supply and demand, rather than new investors buying shares the day before trading.
Spotify declined to comment.
A direct listing would save the music service the underwriting fees needed to launch an initial public offering (IPO), and would avoid diluting the value of existing stakes in the company.
It could also sidestep a surge in first-day trading that often takes place after an IPO, which can signal that a company undervalued its newly issued shares.
The tactic, though rare, is usually used by smaller companies that do not expect high levels of trading in their stock.
A direct listing of a company is ""basically just sticking it on eBay"", says CMC Markets senior market analyst Michael Hewson.
Whereas with an IPO new investors can buy shares from existing investors the day before trading begins, with a direct listing investors buy shares on the open market on the day they are listed for the going rate.
Very rare. ""No-one does it,"" says Mr Hewson. Normally firms use an IPO as an opportunity to make lots of cash.
In general, IPOs can also cost a fair chunk of money, and, crucially for Spotify, they can take a lot of time to set up.
An IPO needs an investment bank or banks to underwrite an issue of new stock. Underwriting often amounts to the bank buying new stock to resell after the company floats.
The bank also looks at the company as part of the process for setting a reasonable initial offer price for the shares. The underwriters ""build a book"" - that is, they go to institutional investors to gauge the appetite for the shares in the company that's going to be floated. Fund managers say how many shares they want and the price they would be willing to pay, and the level of this demand is one of the factors used to set the initial offer price.
All of this to-ing and fro-ing eats up cash and time - and for Spotify, the clock is ticking.
In March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once they list.
But under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the shares are listed.
So as time ticks by, Spotify has to pay more to its creditors, and give them more of a discount on shares.
As well as being a faster process, direct listing also means fewer regulatory hurdles, and it helps keeps expectations about share prices in check.
Spotify, which last year issued a $1bn (Â£801m) convertible bond, was publicly valued at $8.5bn (Â£6.8bn) in 2015.
The Swedish firm was founded more than a decade ago and now has more than 50 million paying subscribers.
This week it also signed a new long-term licensing deal with Universal Music Group, the world's largest record label.
Spotify includes TPG and Goldman Sachs among its major investors.",Spotify is reportedly considering an unconventional direct listing on a stock market that stops short of a full-blown initial public offering.
406,"Global Wireless Solutions polled 2,000 mobile-phone users and found 40% had blackspots at home, with most problems reported in Liverpool and Cardiff.
However telecoms analyst Matthew Howett says the situation is going to improve.
He told the BBC: ""This should get better as operators are using different frequencies to provide coverage.""
He added: ""I don't think the results of the survey are hugely surprising as it is the sort of common problem most of us have experience of - whether at home or increasingly in the office.
""But EE and Three offer something which lets you use your own existing broadband connection and equipment to make and receive calls and text messages although it might not currently work with every device.
""For a long time, Vodafone and others have offered a product called a 'signal booster' which is a piece of hardware you connect to your home broadband to make the above possible and that would support a wider range of devices.
""The advantage of the new solution from EE and Three is that you don't need that bit of kit.""
The survey revealed that the most likely blackspot in people's homes was in the kitchen and that Georgian houses or those built in the 2000s are the hardest in which to get a signal.
Sixty per cent of respondents in Liverpool reported having problems making and receiving calls on their mobiles at home with 54% of people in Cardiff and 53% in Bristol also suffering.
Paul Carter, chief executive officer of GWS, said: ""The UK is no longer a fixed-line nation. When we're at home, we don't just receive calls on our mobiles, we make them too. The best phone is the one you've got on you - not the one sitting in its dock out in the hallway.""
However, the frustrations could soon be at an end, according to Mr Howett.
O2 has committed to a regulatory requirement of providing indoor 4G coverage to 98% of the population by 2017 and he added: ""I would be surprised if this problem lasts beyond then.""","Nearly half of people living in Britain have problems making and receiving mobile calls at home, according to a survey by a network testing company."
407,"Academics from Edinburgh and Essex universities commissioned a survey of several thousand voters.
The results indicated that just 3.4% of ""No"" voters saw ""The Vow"" as the main motivation for their decision.
A spokesman for the SNP said polling immediately after the September vote produced a different result.
The new research by the Centre on Constitutional Change found the biggest factor identified by opponents of independence in making their decision was ""feeling British/believe in the Union"", cited by 29.5%.
Other factors highlighted included:
Factors identified by Yes voters in explaining their defeat included:
Report co-author Ailsa Henderson, of the University of Edinburgh, said: ""There is clearly a divergence between the perception among Yes voters that the offer of more powers was an important aspect of the campaign and reality of how No voters reached their decision.
""The issue of 'more powers' is not cited as the main reason for voting No.
""However, Yes voters are convinced it caused a loss of nerve leading to support for the Union.""
Her colleague Dr Rob Johns, of the University of Essex, added: ""The trajectory of opinion during the campaign suggests that the drift back to No predated the famous 'Vow' on the Daily Record's front cover.
""It is not unusual for a misleading narrative to develop about what swung an election or referendum. According to our data, anyone who thinks 'it was the Vow wot won it' is exaggerating, to say the least.
""However, once these narratives develop, they can be hard to shift. We may well see the effect of this one when voters turn out for the general election in May.""
YouGov questioned 4,849 people between 22 August and 17 September, 2014. They surveyed another 3,719 people from 22 to 26 September.
Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: ""All three pro-UK parties came up with plans for a more powerful Scottish Parliament before the referendum and, whoever is in power after the general election, those powers will be delivered to make Holyrood a more responsible and accountable parliament.
""Contrary to Alex Salmond's bluster, we have all been good to our word on delivering these powers.""
A Scottish Labour spokesman commented: ""While it is interesting to carry out these academic exercises, at the end of the day a substantial majority of the electorate voted to stay part of the UK.""
A spokesman for the SNP said: ""While we were disappointed with the result of the referendum, this study shows that a clear legacy has been greater political involvement, particularly amongst young people, and that is something to be proud of.
""Polling conducted immediately after the referendum showed that a quarter of No voters regarded the promise of extra powers as important in informing their decision - and nearly 10% of No voters only made up their mind in the last week.
""Undoubtedly, the Westminster parties published the Vow because all of their information indicated that it would have a big impact on the result.""","The promise of more powers for Holyrood made little difference to the outcome of the independence referendum, according to a new report."

Moldovan-born Sergiu Ciobanu clocked 2:15.14 with Raheny's Mick Clohisey just ahead of Pollock in 2:15.35.
Ireland will only be able to send three male marathon entrants to Rio so Pollock now faces the prospect of having to run quicker next spring if he wants to maintain his Rio dream.

409,"Minh To, of Stockport, Greater Manchester said he was left ""scared"" and ""terrified"" after seeing pictures of the five-bedroom home on Rightmove.
Police later discovered two men had stolen his mail and forged his signature in order to falsify the documents needed to auction the house.
Two men have been jailed for their part in the scam at Preston Crown Court.
Mike Haley, deputy chief executive of the fraud prevention organisation CIFAS, said Mr To had been ""more vulnerable"" to the fraud because he had paid off his mortgage.
Saeed Ghani and Atif Mahmood both admitted conspiracy to defraud.
Ghani, 30, of Polefield Circle, Prestwich, was jailed for seven and a half years.
Mahmood, 42, of Sarnsfield Close, Gorton, was sentenced to two years and nine months.
On Wednesday a third member of the gang, Toma Ramanauskaite, was sentenced for a separate fraud.
Mr To was first alerted to what was going on when he received a phone call from his daughter in November 2012.
He said: ""She rang me and said 'where are you going?' I said 'I'm going nowhere'. Then she said 'Why are you selling the house then? I've seen it on Rightmove'.
""I didn't know what to think. I felt terrible. I felt scared.""
Mr To logged on to the website to find the advert featured several pictures of his home and was inviting bids starting at £300,000.
The details even included a request that the tenants were ""not to be disturbed"".
Police later discovered Ghani and Mahmood carried out the fraud after stealing three utility bills from Mr To's mailbox.
Having forged his signature, they then transferred the deeds to his house into Ghani's name.
They put the property up for auction in the hope it would sell quickly, without the need for estate agents to show people around.
Mr To discovered the advert just three days before the auction was due to commence.
The court heard Ghani had carried out a similar fraud targeting a couple in Bolton, using fraudulent passports to transfer the deeds to their £300,000 house into his name.
Working with Ramanauskaite, he also took out driving licences in the names of a couple from Salford, before stealing their savings of £90,000.
Ramanauskaite, 30, of Spring Street, Bury, also admitted conspiracy to defraud and was sentenced to 14 months, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 250 hours in unpaid work.
Because Mr To had paid off his mortgage, the men were able to transfer the deeds without needing the extra authority of the lender.
He believes the rules need tightening before more people are targeted.
""It's very simple. The government should make it the law that if you're going to change the land registry deeds you should need two signatures,"" Mr To said.
Det Sgt Phil Larratt, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ""As this case demonstrates, fraudsters can use your identity details to open new bank accounts, request new driving licences and even try and steal your own home.
""We urge the public to secure their mail boxes and employ measures to protect their identities.""","An identity fraud victim has described the horror of discovering his £500,000 home up for sale on a property website."

But Swansea withstood the pressure and, following last Saturday's first league win at Manchester United, are level on points with top-of-the-table Chelsea.
Defeat for Burnley, meanwhile, leaves them still searching for a first Premier League point of the campaign, although their battling display will have been encouraging for manager Sean Dyche.
Swansea boss Garry Monk named an unchanged team from the opening-day triumph at Old Trafford, with new signings Federico Fernandez and Tom Carroll left out of the squad.
Burnley also stuck with the same side which lost 3-1 to Chelsea on Monday, although Stephen Ward was named on the bench after joining from Wolves.
The opening defeat by Chelsea was a chastening reintroduction to Premier League football for the Clarets, who were overwhelmed in midfield, and they were similarly outnumbered by Swansea.
The hosts stretched their opponents at every opportunity, with wingers Dyer and Wayne Routledge particularly threatening in the opening exchanges.
Routledge created early chances for Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson, but it was Dyer who opened the scoring.
Latching on to Sigurdsson's through ball, Dyer scampered into the penalty area and shot low into the net despite a touch from Burnley keeper Heaton.

Swansea were well worth their lead and, apart from a swerving 20-yard shot from Burnley striker Danny Ings, Monk's men were not troubled during a comfortable first half.
They faced a reinvigorated Burnley side after the restart, however, and the visitors were close to equalising when Jutkiewicz headed narrowly over after an hour.
Jones then had a shot palmed wide by Lukasz Fabianski, while Swansea brought on summer signings Bafetimbi Gomis and Jefferson Montero for Bony and Dyer as they sought to regain the initiative.
Although Gomis and Montero injected pace and urgency into the home attack, it was the Swansea defenders who were most influential in the closing moments.
With captain and centre-back Ashley Williams a steadying presence on his 30th birthday, the Swans repelled a flurry of late Burnley attacks to cling on to a second successive win and consign the Clarets to another defeat.
Swansea manager Garry Monk: ""It's a fantastic start and great to have six points.
""It's the best start we could have had, but we know we are only two games from being on your back and getting dragged down.
""We have to build on what we've done and improve on mistakes.""

The results of the election are said to be expected later tonight.
The Gambia has a unique way of voting for the president.
Instead of using ballot papers, voters put a marble into a coloured drum for their candidate.
The system is aimed at tackling illiteracy and preventing rigging.
In the 2011 election, only two votes were declared invalid after people placed their marbles on top of drums.
Observers say Mr Barrow, who, according to British news reports, was once a security guard in the UK high street store Argos, has generated fresh enthusiasm among opposition supporters.
Human rights groups accuse Mr Jammeh, who has in the past claimed he can cure Aids and infertility, of repression and abuses.

414,"After talks with UN and Arab diplomats in Geneva, he said progress had been made on a plan to reduce violence in the second city of Aleppo.
However, he said more work was needed and there was no guarantee of success.
A cessation of hostilities has reduced fighting in Syria's five-year civil war but has unravelled in recent days.
About 250 people have reportedly been killed in Aleppo in the past nine days.
On Monday, fresh government air strikes and artillery attacks on rebel-held districts and suburbs of Aleppo left at least three dead, according to activists.
Mr Kerry, speaking alongside UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura after a morning of talks in Geneva, said the conflict was ""in many ways out of control and deeply disturbing"".
He said the nine-week-old cessation of hostilities had had ""a profoundly positive effect"" and saved many lives, but in recent weeks it had been ""put to the test"".
Mr Kerry said the goal was to reinforce a broad truce that could withstand further tests. He also promised more ceasefire monitors to track violations ""24 hours a day, seven days a week"".
""We're trying to press this as fast as possible but I don't want to make any promises that can't be kept,"" he said.
The US secretary of state said a recent air strike on a hospital in Aleppo, which he blamed on the Syrian government, was ""unconscionable"" but he added that both sides, the opposition and the regime, had contributed to ""this chaos"".
Before leaving Geneva, Mr Kerry spoke by telephone to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Both men reiterated calls for all sides to observe the cessation of hostilities, the Russian foreign ministry said.
Mr de Mistura is due to travel to Russia on Tuesday.
Mr Kerry's trip to Geneva was hastily arranged after Mr de Mistura appealed to the US and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria's five-year conflict, to rescue the cessation of hostilities they brokered in February.
At the start of a meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Monday, Mr Kerry said he would press rebel groups in Aleppo to separate themselves from the powerful jihadist group, al-Nusra Front.
""This is what we're discussing, among other things. There are a number of different ways to approach it,"" Mr Kerry told reporters.
""We're getting closer to a place of understanding. But we have some work to do.""
The Syrian government and Russia have said the Aleppo air strikes are targeting only al-Nusra, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda and is excluded from the cessation of hostilities along with the rival Islamic State group.
However, the opposition and the US have dismissed the claim, and accused the government of targeting civilians and rebels abiding by the cessation of hostilities.
""What is happening in Aleppo is an outrage. It's a violation of all humanitarian laws. It's a crime,"" Mr Jubeir said, adding that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would be held accountable and would be removed from power either through a political process or by force.
The fighting in Aleppo has also seen dozens of civilians killed in rebel artillery attacks on government-held areas.
After at least 50 people were killed in a reported government air strike on a hospital last Wednesday night, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that Aleppo was being ""pushed further to the brink of humanitarian disaster"".
Large parts of the city have been destroyed and its infrastructure has been severely damaged, leaving civilians without water and electricity for months.
The talks in Geneva come a day after the Syrian military extended a ""regime of calm"" around the capital, Damascus, for another 24 hours.
The unilateral truce also covers the northern countryside of the coastal province of Latakia,

""If held under current rules and conditions, a referendum on the status of Darfur cannot be considered a credible expression of the will of the people of Darfur,"" said US State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
The referendum is the last step in a peace process negotiated in Doha. Rebels have long requested more regional powers to end what they see as Khartoum's interference in land ownership conflicts.
If Darfur chose to form one region, it would carry more weight within Sudan, they believe.
But the BBC's West Africa Correspondent Thomas Fessy, who recently visited Darfur with Mr Bashir, says many of those who initially wanted this referendum will be likely to boycott the vote because they say it will not be fair.
More than 2.5m people remain displaced in Darfur and 130,000 more have fled renewed violence this year, the UN says.
Some 300,000 people have been killed since conflict broke out in the troubled region in 2003.
Janjaweed militiamen riding horses spread terror in a multi-layered conflict after rebels took arms against the central government, feeling marginalised.
The Janjaweed were used by the government alongside bombing campaigns. Today, many have been integrated into the Rapid Support Forces, currently fighting in the Jebel Marra region.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has indicted President Bashir on counts of genocide and war crimes committed in Darfur.
Mr Bashir - who has told the BBC he will step down as president in 2020 - has dismissed the ICC as a ""political tribunal"".","The western Sudanese region of Darfur is to vote on its administrative status, 13 years after the start of a conflict which has left 300,000 dead."
416,"Defence coach Shaun Edwards and forwards coach Robin McBryde are out of contract at the end of the World Cup.
And attack coach Rob Howley's deal will expire after next summer's tour.
Given Gatland is under contract until the 2019 World Cup, Davies said he ""may well look to see if there's a need to renew the coaching set-up"".
Head coach Gatland and his assistants have worked together since 2008, winning three Six Nations titles, including two Grand Slams, and fly-half Dan Biggar has said it is vital they remain in place.
Having reached the World Cup semi-final in 2011, they were knocked out at the quarter-final stage this time by a 23-19 loss to South Africa.
Davies said he and Gatland will now evaluate the performances, which included a win over England in the pool stage, and discuss what happens next.
""We'll have a conversation to see how everything went in the competition,"" Davies said.
""It's not just when you fail to get out of the group that needs to be done, like all the focus has been on England.
""There needs to be a review on how we can improve moving forward.""

The Rugby Football Union has begun its inquest into England's disappointing World Cup campaign, which ended at the pool stage following defeats to Wales and Australia at Twickenham.
If the report's conclusion is to sack head coach Stuart Lancaster, reports suggest England may attempt to tempt Gatland away from Wales.
Edwards, who has moulded Wales into one of the world's best defensive outfits, could also be courted by England, especially given his immediate availability.
Gatland's worth to Wales was highlighted in December 2013 when he was given a contract extension until 2019 and Davies fully expects him to see it through.
""I think he's done some really good work to be perfectly honest,"" Davies added.
""If you look at all the difficulties we've had in this competition... the fact is that we've performed better than the expectation, when you consider all the injuries we've had.
""So as I said, Warren has a contract that lasts another four years so it's up to him to assess who he wants for Wales.
""I'm not really interested in all this talk in the papers of who wants him, because that fact is he's under contract with the Welsh Rugby Union.""","Warren Gatland will be the one to decide whether changes are needed to his coaching team, according to Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies."

""Liverpool probably thought it was going to be a lot easier than it turned out,"" Toshack told BBC Radio Wales.
""The way Swansea won it was great. Football is full of these surprises.
""It's one of the results of all time in the history of the football club. It's got to give them a terrific boost.""
Toshack had said Swansea would be relegated from the Premier League prior to their game against Liverpool and questioned Paul Clement's appointment.

The former Liverpool striker said the Swans deserved their victory, however, and claimed it was not only down to a poor Liverpool performance.
""In the first half, Swansea were very well focussed and organised. Liverpool probably thought the game was going to be a lot easier than it turned out to be.
""Swansea, to go away from home and score three goals at Anfield or anywhere in the Premier League is a terrific achievement.

A product of Spurs' academy, he made his first-team debut in 2014 after loan spells at Peterborough and Swindon.
Pritchard, who spent last season on loan at Brentford, where he scored 12 goals in 47 games, has played just once for Spurs this season.
The England Under-21 international signed a new four-year deal with Tottenham last summer.
""It's been a hectic few hours - I was close to going elsewhere,"" he said. ""But when this came about I didn't hesitate to come here.""
""West Bromwich Albion indicated that they had no intention of changing their stance on selling Saido Berahino in advance of deadline day, and were true to their word, despite endless hyping of the possibility from outside.

419,"The Dutchman was teed up on the edge of the area by the excellent Dusan Tadic and connected with the outside of his boot to drive his shot into the top corner as Saints took the lead on 25 minutes.
The Baggies pressed for an equaliser but failed to score for the fifth time in their last six games.
They were continually thwarted by England goalkeeper Fraser Forster who made three stunning saves.
The first saw him claw away a Salomon Rondon header in the first half and he then denied Craig Dawson and Jonny Evans deep into injury time as Saints held on for the win.
Tony Pulis' side have now lost four of their last six and are stuttering in their attempts to achieve their best league finish since 1981, when they came fourth.
The win leaves ninth-placed Southampton just four points behind the Baggies, who stay eighth.
Scotland winger Matt Phillips made his first start since February, but he could not inspire West Brom.
Last season they failed to win any of their last nine league games, with five defeats and four draws.
They are three games into their final nine matches of this campaign and their record reads two defeats and one draw.
While goals are clearly a problem at the moment, the Albion defence is also struggling with just three clean sheets in their last 20 league games.
Albion were not short on chances with 17 shots in the game, six of which were on target. They had 18 attempts in the 2-0 midweek defeat by Watford and Pulis is disappointed his side are not taking their chances.
""We have had 35 shots over the last two games, we need to have more composure and steadiness in front of goal,"" Pulis told BBC Sport.
Still, barring a dramatic collapse, they should be able to achieve the Chinese owners' target of a top-10 finish this season.
Performances like today will put Forster back in contention to challenge Joe Hart for the England jersey.
The 29-year-old made six saves today and manager Claude Puel paid tribute. saying: ""Fraser was the difference at the end, he preserved the three points.""
It was his two injury-time saves that really caught the eye.
In the 93rd minute Jake Livermore played the ball over the top and Dawson managed to connect with a volley that Forster saved at point-blank range.
Two minutes later, Chris Brunt's corner was flicked on by Livermore and Evans' side-footed shot was slapped away by the former Newcastle keeper.
Before those heroics it had been Tadic who had starred for Saints. Since making his Premier League debut in August 2014, following his £10.9m move from FC Twente, he has provided 24 assists.
Only Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas (32), Arsenal's Mesut Ozil (30) and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen (26) have more.
Southampton have now lost just one of their last six league games, after losing six and winning just one of the seven before that.

Puel told BBC Sport: ""It was an excellent performance. We played a good first-half and could have scored another goal. It was a perfect second half, you can see the character of the players and the team.
""To get a clean sheet here is good with the quality of West Brom and the quality of their set-pieces. After the win against Crystal Palace, it's another good performance in terms of consistency.

Pulis told BBC Sport: ""We created better opportunities in the second half and as the game went on we controlled the last 25 minutes and I felt we did enough to get something out of the game.
""It is disappointing considering the chances were there, especially in the second half. We have had 35 shots over the last two games. We need to have more composure and steadiness in front of goal.

420,"Joan Edwards passed away in September 2012, aged 90, and left her estate to ""whichever government is in office at the date of my death for the government in their absolute discretion to use as they may think fit"".
This wording however caused some confusion.
The executors of the will interpreted this to be a donation to the political party in power, and both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats accepted the donation.
The public outcry that followed caused both parties quickly to hand back the money so that it could go to the Treasury.
Miss Edwards had been a nurse, so it was argued by many, that her intention must have been for it to go to the NHS.
It may never be clear what her true intention was - but what is clear is that the wording used in the will was ambiguous.
The second case that has hit the headlines involves an anonymous £500,000 legacy made also to the government in 1928, which came with the strict stipulation that it ""could only be used to reduce the national debt to zero"".
Eighty-five years later and the fund is estimated to be worth £350m, but because the national debt stands at about £1.2 trillion, it cannot be touched.
It would in this instance have been helpful for the will to have contained a clause that covered this scenario, or if the wording was a little more clear.
When the courts have to rule in cases interpreting a will, there is the ""armchair principle"" in England and Wales.
The court will endeavour to discover the intention of the deceased (the ""testator"") and by looking at extra evidence submitted.
It would therefore place itself in the ""armchair"" of the testator and consider the circumstances that surrounded them when they made their will, to assist arriving at their intention.
The law in Scotland and Northern Ireland may differ and separate legal advice should be sought.
Homemade wills need to be very carefully drafted.
It can be a false economy to make a homemade will, if your beneficiaries then face a costly legal battle to prove your intentions in court.
Strict rules governing the way a will is made and executed mean that errors can be made very easily which can invalidate it.
These errors often include not signing the will or having it witnessed correctly.
Source: Susan Midha
The wording of a will can also be problematic as words and terms have specific meanings in law, which may be different to their use by the testator in their will.
There are regularly problems with the naming and the identification of individuals in wills.
Referring to people by nickname, or an abbreviated name, may cause confusion.
Also be careful if you have family members of the same name.
If you are related to two John Smiths but only want one to be a beneficiary, then make sure you specify which one is the true beneficiary.
Don't forget to include substitute beneficiaries if someone you name as a beneficiary dies before you - and don't assume that the children of a deceased beneficiary will (or will not) take their parents' share - there are special rules which can apply.
Altering your will by crossing out sections or making amendments after it has been signed will usually mean the alterations will be invalid and can lead to conflict within the family which can end up in the courts.
And it is worth remembering that your will when proved after your death becomes a matter of public record - which means that any one can look at it and obtain a copy.
So references to, for example, ""that waste of space who is my son"" may be worth avoiding.
If your will is judged to be invalid then your estate would be distributed in accordance with an earlier valid will or by the intestacy laws.
Your intention may not be for the government to benefit, but if there are no family members to inherit and no will, your estate will usually pass to the Crown, ultimately funding the Queen's activities as head of state.

He added that if he acted decisively it would be good for him and for the party.

429,"Mrs May said the convention, which is separate from the EU, ""can bind the hands of Parliament"".
David Cameron has previously refused to rule out leaving the convention.
Ex-cabinet minister and Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said her ""remarkable intervention"" had ""utterly undermined"" the government's position.
In her first major speech of the referendum campaign, Mrs May said the UK had to ""stand tall and lead in Europe"" rather than leaving the EU, and that membership made the UK  ""more secure from crime and terrorism"".
She also raised concerns about more countries joining the EU.
The ECHR, which is separate from the EU institutions, was incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act.
The Conservatives have pledged to replace the Human Rights Act with a ""British Bill of Rights"" but have not proposed leaving the convention altogether.
BBC political editor
The home secretary is one of the most senior politicians in the country. Of course, her backing of the Remain campaign is important. And it's certainly better for the prime minister and the Remain campaign to have her In, rather than Out.
But her qualified support suggests there are three, rather than two, positions at the top of the Conservative party - 'Remain', 'Leave', and perhaps now, 'Reluctant Remain'.
It was the Out campaign struggling to contain their internal differences. Tonight, it feels like cracks might appear on the other side too.

A Downing Street spokeswoman urged journalists not to ""overdo the differences"" between the prime minister and the home secretary on withdrawal from the ECHR.
She said Mr Cameron ""rules nothing out"" as he seeks reform of the convention, saying the home secretary had been ""setting out a clear distinction between the ECHR and the EU"".
Regardless of the outcome of the 23 June EU referendum, Mrs May said she still believed the UK should leave the ECHR which she said ""adds nothing to our prosperity"".
It was the ECHR, not the EU, that was responsible for controversial human rights decision affecting the UK, she said.
Earlier pro-Leave Justice Secretary Michael Gove  warned that five potential new members of the EU - Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Turkey - would result in millions more people having the right to move to the UK.
Mrs May said Albania, Serbia and Turkey had ""poor populations and serious problems with organised crime, corruption, and sometimes even terrorism"".
She added: ""We have to ask ourselves, is it really right that the EU should just continue to expand, conferring upon all new member states all the rights of membership?""
She said the UK had ""forgotten how to lead"" in Europe and must re-assert itself to force change from within, adding that it could veto Turkey joining the EU.
In her speech - and during a question and answer session - Mrs May admitted that being in the EU made it harder to control the ""volume of immigration"". But she said the UK was able to control its border by blocking entry to terrorists.
She praised David Cameron's leadership in trying to seek a better deal for the UK, but said the UK's collective posture was too often to ""blame Europe"" for its problems and the UK ""has to have more confidence to get things done"" rather than ""shouting from the sidelines"".
Mrs May said the issue the British public faced on 23 June was how the UK ""maximised"" its ""prosperity, security, influence and sovereignty"".
In what she said was an analysis of ""the risks and opportunities"" of EU membership rather than an attack on Leave campaigners, she said the post-war order had seen the UK and other countries ""cede sovereignty in a controlled way"" by co-operating to prevent a greater loss of sovereignty through military conflict or economic decline.
Mrs May said the question was not whether the UK could ""survive"" outside the EU given that it was the world's fifth largest economy which had ""friendships and alliances across the world"" - but whether the UK was ""better off in or out"".
While ""the sky would not fall"" in the event of Brexit, she said she had concluded it was a matter of ""hard-headed national interest"" to remain in, based on security, trade and prosperity.
On security, she said EU membership enabled the UK to access EU-wide information, such as criminal records, to allow the UK to turn away serious criminals and terrorists at the border, fast-track the extradition of offenders and simplify the deportation of prisoners.
The UK had extensive intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies outside the EU, she said but being excluded from the EU-wide information sharing would make the UK ""less safe"".
However, she called for major changes to the way the UK did business in the EU, including reducing the power of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice.
Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC the home secretary's comments on the ECHR and EU expansion had ""thrown the gauntlet down"" to the government.
On EU expansion, he claimed, the prime minister is ""in favour of extending our borders to Syria"" by allowing Turkey to join the EU.
""She actually basically questions the very campaign she says that she supports,"" he said.
""This is a remarkable intervention. She has really thrown the gauntlet down and undermines the whole of the 'vote stay in' campaign.""
Mr Duncan Smith said immigration was ""out of control"" and free movement of people rules meant the UK had to accept criminals coming into the country.
""An elected government in the UK elected on a platform to reduce immigration right now cannot deliver that because the EU is an open border,"" he told Radio 4's Today.
""You cannot reject anyone unless you can demonstrate categorically that they pose an immediate threat to the life and livelihood of the UK.""",Home Secretary Theresa May has said the UK should quit the European Convention on Human Rights while remaining in the European Union.

433,"Vauxhall's pension scheme is one of the largest in the UK, with 15,000 members.
Pensions expert John Ralfe said Peugeot owner PSA would not want to touch it ""with a barge pole"", saying he thought it had a deficit of about £1bn.
Half of the members were pensioners, Mr Ralfe told the BBC's Today programme.
The proposed sale will be discussed in the Commons on Monday afternoon after the Speaker granted an urgent question on the matter to the Labour MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston, Justin Madders.
Meanwhile a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that Prime Minister Theresa May was planning to meet Carlos Tavares, PSA chief executive, but a time and date for the meeting had not yet been fixed.
According to company filings to the end of 2014 - the latest available - the Vauxhall pension scheme had assets of about £1.8bn but liabilities of about £2.6bn, leaving a deficit of £840m.
Since then record low interest rates have hit the returns on government debt in which big pension schemes invest heavily, so the deficit had probably grown, Mr Ralfe said.
Last week it emerged that PSA Group, which also makes Citroen cars, was in talks about taking over GM's loss-making European business, Opel.
Mr Ralfe told Today the size of the deficit was a ""major issue for the takeover"". ""At best it's a stumbling block, at worst it could be a deal breaker,"" he said.
He said he was clear that PSA would not want to take on the pension scheme so they would only buy the operating assets, including the plant and the Vauxhall brand, leaving the pensions with General Motors UK.
""The trouble with that is that would then be a company with no assets, so what would have to happen ... is that General Motors US would have to issue a guarantee for that UK company,"" Mr Ralfe said.
PSA, which already works with GM in Europe on several projects, said a takeover was among ""numerous strategic initiatives"" being considered.
Any deal would involve Opel's UK arm, Vauxhall, which employs 4,500 staff at plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.
Unite union leader Len McCluskey is also due to meet Mr Tavares this week to discuss the deal and any impact it might have on jobs.
Mr Ralfe said he did not think the Vauxhall pensioners needed to be worried about their position, but said that while politicians were ""running around all over the place asking about jobs, they should also be running around asking about pensions"".","Plans to sell the European arm of General Motors - including Vauxhall - to France's PSA Group could be derailed by the deficit in GM's UK pension scheme, an expert says."
434,"The government accepted recommendations by the Senior Salaries Review Body, saying pay restraint was one of the ""difficult choices"" it faced.
The award comes amid a row over the 1% cap on public sector rises.
After the general election, some ministers suggested a rethink, putting pressure on Chancellor Philip Hammond.
The government says its policy has not changed, and last week teachers were told they faced another year of 1% rises.
Most public sector pay is set by ministers after receiving recommendations from different pay review bodies.
These bodies have to take into account government policy, which since 2013 has been for a 1% increase across the public sector, although in theory they are able to recommend higher increases.
The Senior Salaries Review Board covers the senior civil service, senior military officers, the judiciary and senior managers working for arm's length bodies of the Department of Health.
For each group, the board recommended a 1% rise, which has been accepted by ministers.
In a written statement, Cabinet Office Minister Damian Green said the government ""greatly values"" public servants' work and understands the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff.
He added: ""However, there is a trade-off between pay and jobs in many public services, and pay restraint is one of the many difficult choices the government has had to make to help put the UK's public finances back on track.
""Senior public sector workers, like everyone else, will have to continue to play their part to ensure we deliver job security for working people across the country.""
Naomi Cooke, of senior civil servants' union the FDA, welcomed a government promise of a review of senior salaries, but added: ""What should be abundantly clear is that this cannot be achieved within a 1% straitjacket.
""Reform of senior civil service pay needs to be fully funded and it needs to happen soon - the current government pay policy is failing and is doing so in a way that costs civil servants and costs the public dear.""","Senior civil servants, military officers and judges are to receive 1% pay rises this year, ministers have announced."

More updates on BBC Live: Sussex
Industrial action by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and high levels of staff sickness have hit services, with the introduction of a temporary emergency timetable initially cutting up to 341 trains a day.
Mr Maynard told the Commons: ""Some routes are still suffering badly and my priority is making sure services are being restored in a timely, sensible and lasting manner.""
""The real solution here is for the RMT to bring this dispute to a close and start to put passengers first,"" he added.
Mr Maynard also denied plans for ""more generous"" compensation to Southern Rail commuters affected by strikes were on the ""backburner"".
He also agreed to consider calls for season ticket holders to receive a rebate of up to 20%.
Meanwhile, Southern announced it would reinstate the full timetable from Tonbridge and Reigate to Redhill and London Victoria/London Bridge on Monday.
Alex Foulds, Southern's passenger services director, apologised to customers ""who have suffered ever since the RMT began their unnecessary action"".
He said the temporary weekday timetable had been delivering a ""more consistent, reliable"" service.
""We are steadily reintroducing trains and will continue to do so until the entire timetable is back in place,"" he added.
Mick Cash, RMT general secretary, called the changes ""pitiful"".
He added: ""The fact passengers are still paying through the nose for a vastly reduced service is solely due to the gross managerial incompetence and profiteering of this basket-case rail operator.
""Yet again Southern are blaming their staff for their own systemic failures...""

If the offence is racially or religiously aggravated, the current seven-year maximum will go up to 14.
Labour said ministers had ""changed their mind"" under pressure, having previously opposed tougher penalties.
In 2015, 194 people were convicted of stalking in England and Wales and were, on average, sentenced to 14 months in jail.
The government is expected to bring in the changes in an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill, when it is debated in the Commons on Tuesday. The bill, which is in its final stages in Parliament, is likely to become law in the coming weeks.
It will also raise the maximum sentence for harassment from five to 10 years, and similarly from seven to 14 if it is racially or religiously aggravated.

Mr Gyimah said the sentences were being doubled so these ""awful crimes can be properly punished"".
But Labour said its amendment to the bill in the House of Lords in December, which would have doubled maximum sentences for the most serious offences, had been opposed by the government.
The amendment was approved by the Lords by 160 votes to 149 but 139 Conservative peers voted against.
However two Conservative MPs, Alex Chalk and Richard Graham, had campaigned to increase punishment for stalking. Mr Chalk introduced a private member's bill last year calling for the maximum sentence to be doubled.
Labour says there was a chance of a ""sizeable rebellion"" among Conservative MPs if the government sought to overturn the move when MPs debate it.
""Thankfully, under pressure, the Tories have changed their mind,"" said shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon.
""But more still needs to be done to ensure that victims of stalking feel confident enough that their complaint will be investigated properly when they first report it.""
Last month, new stalking protection orders were introduced to protect victims - especially those targeted by strangers or colleagues - at the very earliest possible stage.
Police in England and Wales can now apply to the courts for an order before a stalking suspect has been convicted or even arrested.
A typical order might ban the suspect from going near the victim or contacting them online, and could also make them undergo treatment if they have a mental health problem.
The orders follow legislation introduced in 2012 which made stalking a specific criminal offence in England and Wales.
In Scotland, stalking is illegal under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 and in Northern Ireland it is prohibited under the Protection from Harassment Order (NI) 1997.",The maximum sentence for stalking available to courts in England and Wales is to rise from five years to 10.

But he told BBC News it would be ""not surprising"" if they had serious doubts about the direction Labour was taking under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.
Mr Farron said he was contacted via text messages after Mr Corbyn was elected Labour leader on Saturday.
He said he had also spoken on the telephone to Labour MPs, but he declined to name names or say whether they were front bench figures.
Speaking to the Evening Standard, he said: ""I've had various unsolicited texts, some of them over the weekend, where I felt like I was being an agony aunt rather than anything else.
""People who have been members of the [Labour] party for as long as I've been a member of mine who feel that they don't recognise their party anymore and feel deeply distressed.""
Mr Farron, who was elected Lib Dem leader in July, was speaking ahead of the party's annual conference in Bournemouth, which gets under way at the weekend.
It is the party's first gathering since its crushing defeat at May's general election, when it lost all but eight of its MPs.
Mr Farron has called the election of Mr Corbyn a ""quite staggering opportunity"" for his party to occupy the centre ground in British politics, which he believes is being rapidly vacated by the New Labour leader in favour of a hard left agenda.
Quizzed about his contacts with Labour MPs on the BBC's Look North, he said: ""I am keen to be a decent sort and not betray any confidences - but it would be not surprising if Labour MPs, voters, members and indeed donors were thinking hang about this isn't the Labour Party that I voted for, I need a party that will hold the Tories to account, that can beat the Tories and which believes not just in social justice and fairness, but also in sound economics.

He played most of the 27-23 win over Scotland, but had his foot strapped after being replaced in the 76th minute.
""He (Biggar) is tough, so let's just hope he keeps going and doing what he has been doing,"" Jenkins told BBC Radio Wales.
""We need him to keep playing as well as he has. If sides target him, that is a positive for us, because it shows how well he has been playing.
""We can't hide him. Wherever he plays, unless we get him a seat near the posts, he will be targeted, (as) he was against Ireland and Scotland.
""If they want to target him, he is good enough and strong enough to deal with that and he should take it as a compliment.""

Defeat saw four-time winners Arsenal fail to reach the final for the first time in the cup's six-year history.
City will play at their own Academy Stadium in the final against Birmingham City on Sunday, 2 October, after their 4-0 win at London Bees on Saturday.
After City keeper Marie Hourihan had denied Asisat Oshoala on multiple occasions, the ball deflected straight to Beattie in the Arsenal six-yard box from a Toni Duggan free-kick with 11 minutes remaining and she fired in to win the game.
The winner came moments after Danielle Carter's powerful effort for the Gunners had struck the crossbar, and England captain Steph Houghton cleared the ball off the line late on to deny Arsenal again.

""This was a calculated attempt to run him over and use your car as a weapon,"" the judge said.
""It would have been obvious that to do so would have carried significant risk of injury.""
The court heard how the pair nearly collided on Stoke Newington High Street on 10 February 2016, when Henshaw-Bryan pulled out in front of the cycle courier while using her mobile.

453,"Sport Wales said it would not consider the organisation's application for future public funding unless new directors were appointed.
It said it was clear the board was not following its own rules for recruitment, board meetings and other key decisions.
One former director said the ultimatum was ""short-sighted"" and ""vindictive"".
David Francis, another former Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) chairman, said Sport Wales, which hands out funding, told him money would stop if he and his colleagues refused to step down.
He said there had been a ""relationship breakdown"" with a Sport Wales-backed consultant brought in to address governance issues.
The consultant was appointed after auditors found WABA was ""not fit for purpose"" in 2013, and ""partly implemented"" recommendations by 2015.
In minutes from the last meeting of Welsh Boxing's governing body, in February, issues such as ""missing money"" and the administration of ""medical cards"" were discussed.
Mr Francis said Sport Wales had ""worked hard to get rid"" of the board for several months.
""We were requested to step down in February as a board and told that the chair and vice chair cannot stand again,"" he added.
Mr Francis said Sport Wales said it was in relation to the information given to them by the consultant.
He said he had a ""difference of opinion"" with the consultant, but Sport Wales took the side of the consultant.
He said the 114 clubs the association worked with were ""perfectly happy with what we do"".
BBC Wales has seen an email from one of WABA's former directors, John Wheatley, describing the decision as ""short-sighted"" and ""vindictive"".
""Sport Wales are supposed to give reason for their actions at the divisional meetings, though I doubt very much if they will actually appear at any meeting personally,"" he told clubs.
Brian Davies, of Sport Wales, said progress had been made until last October, but since then there were ""some clear signs of a lack of good governance, processes not being followed, the organisation's own articles of association not being implemented properly"".
""Those are alarm bells in terms of an organisation that really is there to serve its membership,"" he added.
Mr Davies said Sport Wales could no longer have confidence in the people in charge of WABA.
He said it was not critical of the board's dedication, enthusiasm, and commitment, but added: ""We need the right people leading an organisation of this nature if we are going to invest public funds in it.""
He rejected the criticisms of the decision, saying: ""I would understand disappointment, but 'vindictive', no.""
Mr Davies said Sport Wales wanted boxing to improve and had to take steps.
He said the board had held meetings outside its remit and had not followed its own rules.
He added: ""They signed up to a code of good governance and we don't think they are implementing that governance"".","The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association board has been forced to resign over a ""lack of confidence in governance""."

They also show a 22% increase in faults from 2012/13, which has drawn criticism from commuters faced with rising prices.
Network Rail blamed a lack of railway investment for the increase.
Signalling systems can fail for a number of reasons, such as power cuts or blown fuses, which cause signals to turn black and drivers to stop their trains.
A spokeswoman said the age of the equipment was the cause of the problems.
""We are replacing all of the signalling equipment along the Western route as part of our Â£7.5bn modernisation programme,"" she said.
During the 2013/14 financial year there was 379 signal problems and in 2012/13 the number was 337.
Sim Harris, the managing editor of Railnews magazine, said the signalling problems were causing ""major disruption to thousands of people"".
He said: ""The problem with the signalling between Oxford and Reading, which is where these problems do occur, is that it's getting on [in age].""
Simon Stevenson, 42, from North Oxford, is a company director and commutes into London two or three times a week.
He said: ""There seems to be a disconnect. We have constant increases in fares, but that doesn't translate into improvements in service.""

""Commuting to London costs an arm and a leg, so when you are delayed most mornings because you are sat somewhere just outside Reading it feels like you are being taken for a ride,"" he said.",The Oxford to London Paddington line suffered the equivalent of more than one signal problem every day last year.

Fermanagh host Derry next Sunday, with Down travelling to take on Cork.
Danny Tallon scored a goal in either half but Derry were unable to contain a dangerous Cork forward line in their Football League encounter.
Cork led 0-10 to 1-6 after a first half which saw play delayed for 15 minutes for treatment to Derry's Jason Rocks.
Tallon's second goal restored parity at 2-9 to 0-15 but points from Colm O'Neill (2) Mark Collins, Paul Kerrigan and Barry O'Driscoll gave Cork victory.
Oak Leafers boss Damian Barton included Slaughtneil pair Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers in his line-up but it was Cork who moved ahead at 0-4 to 0-2.
Ciaran Mullan replaced the injured Rocks, who was taken away by ambulance, while Cork's Peter Kelleher hit the bar for the visitors.
Tallon found the net late in the half and Benny Heron's point before the break reduced the home side's deficit to one point by the interval.
O'Neill and Neil Forrester traded points at the start of the second half, then Cork pushed ahead, despite Tallon's second goal.
Down went in level with Galway at half-time at Pairc Esler, with Caolan Mooney excelling with two fantastic points from long range.
Darragh O'Hanlon was also a regular points-scorer for the hosts, but the second half began badly for the Ulster county as they conceded two goals within a minute.
Goalkeeper Michael Cunningham was sent-off for a foul on Gary Sice, with Eamonn Brannigan scoring the resulting penalty.
Shane Walsh was next to find the net, although Galway suffered a setback soon after when Declan Kynne received a straight red card for an off-the-ball challenge on Barry O'Hagan.
O'Hagan's goal reduced Down's arrears to 2-9 to 1-9 by 49 minutes but despite three further points by O'Hanlon, it was the visitors who dominated for the remainder of the game.
Marc Reid saved a penalty but Eamonn Brannigan scored on the rebound to help ensure victory for Galway.
Fermanagh got off to a good start with points from Sean Quigley and Ryan Lyons but it was the home side who assumed control thereafter, enjoying a 2-6 to 0-4 advantage by the interval.
Donal Lenihan and Bryan McMahon scored the first-half goals, with Graham Reilly, Bryan Menton, McMahon and Donal Keogan all registering scores.
The Ernemen's other first-half points came from Kane Connor and a Quigley free.
Early second-half points from Sean Tobin and Cillian O'Sullivan were followed by a third Meath goal from Tobin, before Lee Cullen recorded Fermanagh's first score of the second half for 3-9 to 0-5.
Meath scored six of the match's remaining seven points to clinch a comfortable success.

The nets have been thrown on to a roof and into trees almost every day since she put them up on Sunday night.
However, Mrs Whitford put her story online and said so many people saw it, everyone ""now knows about the fair"".
She and her friend Anne Walls crocheted covers for bollards in the centre of town and a large net to cover the Royse Stone - a landmark that used to contain a cross, and which gives the town its name.
They put them up, together with crocheted bunting ""under cover of darkness, like all good guerrilla knitters and yarn bombers do"", she said.
However, on Monday morning they were gone. Mrs Whitford posted ""missing"" notices on local Facebook group pages. The items mysteriously reappeared that afternoon.
On Tuesday, the nets were discovered strewn on the pavement and thrown into trees. They were retrieved and returned to their rightful positions.
The following day the stone cover was spotted on the roof of a bank.
Staff from a nearby pub brought out a stepladder and retrieved the cover for Mrs Whitford.

At Glasgow Sheriff Court, all three men were ordered to carry out 126 hours of unpaid work.
Passing sentence, Sheriff Alayne Swanson branded the damage they caused in the Necropolis ""absolutely disgusting"".

Unassisted and unsupported, he will receive no outside help such as a re-supply by air, and no support from animals or vehicles.

On Thursday afternoon, Jackson Page was meant to be taking part in a physical education lesson at Ebbw Fawr Learning Community in Blaenau Gwent.
Instead, the 15-year-old from Ebbw Vale found himself in front of the television cameras at Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena, playing former world number one Judd Trump for a place in the last 16 of the Welsh Open.
Having beaten Jason Weston and John Astley in the first and second rounds, Page attracted a big crowd; the locals curious to see if this improbably bearded schoolboy could continue his improbable run.
However, his match against Trump - the winner of six ranking titles - proved a bridge too far for the Welsh teenager.
Page was brave in his shot selection and eager to match his opponent's attacking instincts, but was ultimately outclassed as Trump ruthlessly raced to a 4-0 win.
""It was great out there but there were a lot of nerves and pressure too,"" says Page, remarkably calm and level-headed for a 15-year-old.
""It's been great - I've loved every minute of it. My friends have been proud of me and enjoyed watching me. Now it's back to blazers and ties.
""No-one likes school really. When I'm there I just can't wait to get into the snooker hall.""
Luckily for Page, his teachers recognise his potential and are happy for him to forego as many lessons as is necessary for him to pursue his snooker ambitions.
After a week in school, Page will travel to Cyprus for the European Championships, where winning the under-21 or senior competition would give him the opportunity to turn professional.

With Page in Cyprus will be his mother Clare, who along with father Andrew, has been integral to his snooker development.
Being the parents of a budding player has meant driving him from school to the local snooker hall every day, then for a whole day of practice on Saturdays and usually a tournament on Sundays - of which Page enters about 33 a year.
""We're so proud, we just can't believe it,"" says Clare.
""We came down here with no expectation. He did, he had expectation because he's got all the confidence in the world.
""We were just thinking we've got a couple of days off work, we'll come down with him, and my head was mostly down because I couldn't watch.""
Andrew was the first person Jackson saw as he left the table after his first and second-round wins, and he begins to well up as he reflects on his son's achievement.
""It's emotional. Even seeing him walk out on the big stage, you get a lump in your throat,"" says Andrew, his eyes glistening as he struggles to restrain his tears.
""When that last black went in - I don't know if it was the first round or the second, I can't remember - I was the first one out of there, before anyone could see me crying.""
The pride, warmth and sheer enthusiasm with which Page's parents speak is infectious. They joke that it is just as well they have only one son - as they would simply not have the time to support another child as lovingly or committedly.

Page, while equally amenable and friendly, is more reserved. His is a temperament made for professional sport.
Perhaps it is a quality he has gleaned from two-time world champion Mark Williams, who is from Cwm - just a couple of miles away from Ebbw Vale - and has been helping Page train.
""He's very laid back, which is a good trait to have,"" Page says. ""I've played with Mark on the practice tables a few times. You learn off him and get tips off him.""
Williams, a former world number one with 18 ranking titles and about £5m in prize money to his name, will be a valuable influence as Page aims to establish himself.
The financial rewards for leading snooker players can be great and, this week, Page got a taste of things which might be to come.
Reaching the third round of the Welsh Open earned him £3,500 - a far cry from the pocket money or paper rounds with which most 15-year-olds have to make do.
True to form, the measured Page plans to put the majority of that sum in the bank. Surely, though, after such a remarkable week, he can afford himself a little treat?
He ponders his options, smiles and says: ""I might get a McDonalds later.""

""Almost every day I come up with a few song titles or a sweet melody,"" says the 70-year-old, who claims to have written more than 3,000 songs in her career.
Her latest album, Pure & Simple, came out on Friday, featuring new songs with stripped-down arrangements that recall the early days of her career.
It has an overwhelmingly romantic theme, inspired by renewing her wedding vows earlier this year. And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.
""I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,"" she says. ""I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.""
The BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.
First of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!
Thank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.
What's the secret?
We've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?
You renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?
That was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.
Did you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?
Well, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!
That sense of romance permeates your new album.
Oh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.
You've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?
Love is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!
How often do you write?
I write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.
Is that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, ""I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?""
Well, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.
In Head Over High Heels, you sing about ""painting my eyes like Adele."" What made you write about her?
Everyone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all ""Adele this"" and ""Adele that!"" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, ""can you fix my eyes like Adele?""
When I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, ""This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes"". And all of a sudden it's like, ""And my eyes like Adele!""
What do you think her reaction will be?
I think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!
I just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.
You both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than youâ€¦ I wondered what you made of that?
Oh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.
What's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?
Oh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.
The song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?
Yeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.
Another one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, ""Look at her, she thinks she's 16!"" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.
Goes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.
What age do you think of yourself as?
I'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided ""I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.""
What inspired Can't Be That Wrong?
That was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.
I based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, ""That's a strong-ass love, right there"". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, ""wow, this would make a great song.""
The last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?
That'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.
I wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, ""I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?""
And so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, ""Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?""
They call that part of the day the ""legends slot"". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?
I don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.
But I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.

Clement was interviewed by the club before Bob Bradley was appointed as their manager in October.
He is set to be Swansea's third manager of the season and it is likely he will be at Selhurst Park for their game against Crystal Palace on Tuesday.
The former Chelsea and Real Madrid assistant manager was in charge of Derby County for eight months before he was sacked by the club in February of 2016.
After Bradley was sacked following a spell of seven defeats in 11 games, Clement emerged as the frontrunner to be Swansea's next manager
Former Manchester United assistant Ryan Giggs, Wales boss Chris Coleman and former Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett were also linked with the job.
The Swans are four points adrift at the bottom of the table and have lost their last four games, including Saturday's 3-0 home defeat by Bournemouth.",Bayern Munich assistant Paul Clement has agreed a two-and-a-half year deal to become Swansea City's next manager.
470,"The number of children at significant risk of exploitation in the city has more than doubled, new figures show.
Trafficking cases across Wales also rose from 34 to 50 in the last year.
But experts say the figures are only the tip of the iceberg - with many cases not officially recorded.
A task force set up by Cardiff council heard from police and many of the 50 different bodies working on the issue.
""The evidence demonstrates that trafficking in Cardiff is increasing, for all types and for all reasons,"" says its report.
The number of children in the city regarded as being at ""significant risk"" of sexual exploitation has jumped from 12 to 28 between 2012/2013 and 2013/2104, according to the children's charity Barnardo's.
The council task force found:
The report also points to five court cases in the area in the last three years, including the case in January of a couple jailed for trafficking two Czech women to work as prostitutes.
There was another trafficking case which saw women moved around the UK including to two places in Cardiff.
Cardiff council has been regarded as leading the field in tackling trafficking but it is looking at what more it can do.
This includes raising awareness at spotting signs of trafficking and improving training for staff.
Another concern has been a two-year waiting list for those who have been exploited and need help for post-traumatic stress.
There are also concerns some victims have been offered unsuitable accommodation and qualified social workers have not been available when cases are first referred.
The Black African Women Step Out (Bawso) charity which helps victims of exploitation from ethnic communities, said trafficking has always existed but there is now more awareness from professionals in health and education.
Dr Mwenya Chimba, director of violence against women at Bawso, said: ""The problem is very big but the referrals don't reflect the extent of it.
""More recently it's not just the sex trade but forced labour and other forms of exploitation.""
Case study - Mary
Mary travelled to the UK from West Africa illegally when she was 14.
She believed she was travelling to a job looking after children in London which would allow her to go to school herself.
But when she arrived in London, after using counterfeit travel documents, she was taken to a house where there were five other girls of various nationalities being forced to work as prostitutes.
She spent a year at the house being made to work as a prostitute and her earnings were confiscated.
Police spotted her during a raid at the house and she was placed in foster care before being referred to the anti-trafficking team.
She was given help and refuge accommodation in Cardiff where it emerged she was pregnant.
She is waiting for a decision to be made on her claim for asylum.
Mary's name has been changed
Yvonne Rodgers, director of Barnardo's Cymru, said closer work between police, councils and the charity had led to more children identified as being at risk of trafficking, more referrals and more protection for victims.
""We need to continue this pattern and see the police authorities in Wales using their full range of law enforcement and disruption tactics to arrest and deter the abusers and protect children from this horrific abuse,"" she added.
A large number of cases in UK are from countries like Nigeria, Vietnam, China, Albania and Romania.
A council spokesperson said two of its committees had produced a ""comprehensive and useful report on this important issue, which takes many forms and which has a profound impact on both children and adults"".
It said it looked forward to seeing the recommendations implemented soon.","Human trafficking in Cardiff is increasing year-on-year, with women being exploited for sex and children forced to work, says a new report."
471,"Media playback is not supported on this device
Their relationship has been the subject of intense media scrutiny, with both insisting there is no rift.
They meet in Lyon on Wednesday, Wales' first semi-final at a major tournament.
""It's not about two players, it is about two nations in a semi-final, 11 men against 11 men,"" said Wales' Bale.
""Everybody knows that really.""
Bale became the world's most expensive footballer when he joined Real from Tottenham for £85m in 2013, surpassing the £80m the Spanish club paid Manchester United for Ronaldo in 2009.
The two players have formed a potent attacking three with French striker Karim Benzema, helping Real to win two Champions League titles in the past three seasons.
However, the relationship between Bale and Ronaldo has not always been harmonious.
The Portugal captain was pictured gesticulating angrily when Bale did not pass to him during a game in 2015, prompting speculation of discord between the pair.
Both have dismissed such talk, while former Real manager Carlo Ancelotti said in a recent BBC Wales documentary about Bale that the two players are ""really close"".
""Of course we get on very well at Madrid, we enjoy playing with each other,"" said Bale.
""He's a fantastic player, everybody knows what he can do. But we have always spoken about what we do, what we do ourselves as a team. We don't worry about the opposition.""
Wednesday's match in Lyon will be Ronaldo's third European Championship semi-final, and he was part of the Portugal side which lost the 2004 final to Greece.
Bale's three goals have helped Wales reach the last four of a major tournament for the first time, and he has reiterated his belief that Chris Coleman's men could be crowned champions.
""We all believed from the start. As we have said many times, we didn't come here to make up the numbers,"" he added.
""We came here to do a job, we came to do the business. Ultimately we want to win the tournament.
""We know we're a step closer again but, the thing we keep saying time and time again, we can't think past the semi-final now.
""We have to concentrate everything on the semi. If we can get the job done, then we can look forward to the final.""
With Wales making their first appearance at a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup, Bale is glad he no longer has to endure taunts from his Real team-mates.
""I remember [Germany midfielder] Toni Kroos saying we'd only have three games. So it would be nice to meet him in the final,"" he said.
""It was a good laugh and a joke - a bit of banter. I have had a lot of abuse over the years, when we used to lose and when we were 100th in the world. You have nine weeks' holiday instead of two.
""It is good to finally be in a major tournament actually doing great things with our national team. It is great to be part of and we have loved every moment of it and we will continue to do that.""
While Kroos may await in the final if Wales make it, Bale can look forward to facing Real centre-back Pepe - if fit - as well as Ronaldo in Wednesday's semi-final against Portugal.
The Wales forward has also brought his Real physiotherapist, Jaime Benito, with him to France to work alongside the international backroom staff.
""I had a few injuries this year and coming to a big tournament I haven't experienced it before so I wanted to make sure I was fully fit and if there was a problem I can get it fixed straight away,"" Bale added.
""It's been a massive help for me and even the medical staff here have probably needed it more because they didn't want to take any of the others out for so long and leave any of the other boys without treatment. It was a good decision all round and it's working well.""

Public Space Protection Orders (PSPO) will be imposed in the city centre, banning people from begging and causing a public nuisance.
Some beggars have claimed there is not enough support for them.
Cabinet member Jennie Dallimore said some of those causing problems were ""housed and in receipt of benefits"" which she said ""cannot be tolerated"".
The new powers were given to councils under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014. A PSPO was used to stop people taking legal highs around Taunton.
If people flout the new rules and refuse to engage with the council or drug charities, they could be fined or prosecuted.
Councillors at Wednesday's cabinet meeting also agreed an awareness campaign to raise better understanding of the support available for rough sleepers.
Martin, who begs on the streets, told the BBC: ""I want to get myself clean but there's no help.
""I need help now, not in a few months down the line. At the end of the day they should sit here, then they would understand.
""I'm not abusive, I'm polite, I'm only sat here, I'm not going out shoplifting or going and mugging people.""
But Ms Dallimore said support is available for those who want to tackle their addictions.

475,"David Leyonhjelm, a cat-loving former veterinarian and Liberal Democratic senator for New South Wales, has twice been elected to federal parliament, and is one of a disparate group of cross-benchers who hold the balance of power in an unpredictable upper house.
He is his libertarian party's sole representative in Canberra, and has been branded ""the nastiest, most sexist politician in Australia"" by Sydney Morning Herald columnist Peter FitzSimons.
FitzSimons, a former rugby union international, told his readers a story about an elderly female reader who had taken exception to the senator's relaxed view on Donald Trump's crass remarks about women.
She complained and received a brusque response saying she was ""not fit to use a computer"".
""Apparently a constituent wrote to me and made some fairly silly remarks.  I have a fairly low tolerance for idiots,"" Senator Leyonhjelm told the BBC from his offices in Sydney.
""It was fairly idiotic email, so I wrote back to her and called her a bimbo.  I had no idea [but] it turns out she is in her 70s or 80s or something like that and she complained to this sports writer.""
""He contacted my office and asked for a comment and one of my staff replied we had no comment for him about the particular matter butâ€¦ said 'well, usually he [the Senator] tells people like that to [profanity]-off, and he didn't in this case, so we're worried that he is mellowing.
""Apparently that enraged this guy.""
It sure did. A fired-up FitzSimons added that ""with such personal abuse, the Senator disgraces the office he holds"".
This is not the first time the Liberal Democratic MP has been castigated in the press. In August, the Herald labelled him a ""hate-speech apologist"" and ""a boorish, supercilious know-all with the empathy of a [concrete] besser block"".
At issue is the senator's push to repeal section 18C of Australia's Racial Discrimination Act, which outlaws behaviour that is likely to ""offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate"" someone because of their race or ethnicity. Here is where he channels memories of ""Chopper"" Read, who died in 2013 after serving 23 years in jail in Australia for kidnapping and malicious wounding.
""Our right to free speech is not a frivolous matter, but it is time for sooks and whingers to take a leaf from Chopper. It's not the government's job to protect us from hurt feelings,"" Senator Leyonhjelm said on his official website.
Feelings were certainly singed following a tweet soon after the death from cancer of the celebrated sports journalist Rebecca Wilson.
""Doubt there'll be many #WSW [Western Sydney Wanderers] fans at Rebecca Wilson's funeral #innocentlivesdamaged,"" he tweeted in reference to the late reporter's identification of fans allegedly on a banned list for poor behaviour, most of whom were followers of Western Sydney Wanderers.
""He takes bluntness to a higher level. He can be obscene at times but it is in Australia's more rough and tumble tradition,"" explained Dr Peter Chen, senior lecturer in the department of government and international relations at the University of Sydney.
""He originally was a member of the Labor Party. He joined the Liberal Party and he fell out with both sides of politics, most recently with his membership of the Liberal Party over the introduction of gun laws in Australia following the Port Arthur shooting about 20 years ago,"" Dr Chen added.
Senator Leyonhjelm is broadly in favour of immigration, supports same-sex marriage, lower taxes and assisted suicide, but it's restrictions on firearms that make his blood boil.
""I find that distressing because it is wrong and it is very unkind to me and 800,000 licensed shooters in the country, who are absolutely vilified, treated like we are criminals-in-waiting and whose sporting implements are constantly under threat,"" he explained.
His critics argue that his stance on guns ignores the opinions of most Australians, who back tough laws.
""He is using extreme tactics to push through his quite dangerous agenda,"" said fellow New South Wales Senator Lee Rhiannon, from the Greens, who is her party's gun control spokesperson. ""He has been provocative, blunt, extreme, at times rude.""
She concedes, however, that Senator Leyonhjelm and Pauline Hanson's right-wing anti-immigration One Nation Party are tapping into anti-establishment rage in Australia.
""We're seeing a real anger build up within the community with regard to machine politics, the political class, whatever name you want to call it, who are worried how their kids are going to buy a home and feeling left out of how society is working,"" Ms Rhiannon told the BBC.
""They think that globalisation has robbed them of a life that they think is fair.""
The Liberal Democrats say they have recruited hundreds of disaffected former supporters of the governing Liberal Party and hope to mount a show of force at the next year's state election in Western Australia.
That campaign promises to be anything but dull. Lampooned by TV comedians in June, Senator Leyonhjelm reacted in trademark fashion by swearing at the crew and telling them to leave.","He's labelled a fellow Australian MP a ""dumb heap of parrot droppings"", has put forward a law inspired by notorious criminal Mark ""Chopper"" Read and unleashed profanities to silence his critics on Twitter."

Shah was ordered to serve a minimum of 28 years for the murder and received a concurrent six year sentence for robbery.
The Met Police said he had ""deprived a young daughter of her mother"".
Ms Popa, a Romanian national, had arrived in the UK only weeks before her murder, police said.
She had a six-year-old daughter and  was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time of her death, officers said.
On 28 October police patrolling the area said they spoke to her three times and issued her with a caution for soliciting.
CCTV footage showed Ms Popa walking along with Shah and his bicycle shortly before 00:00 BST, before he took a knife from his back pocket and stabbed her in the chest.
Shah made off on his bike, while Ms Popa ran to a nearby shop where she collapsed. She was taken to an east London hospital where she died shortly afterwards.
The post-mortem examination found the 24-year-old died from shock and haemorrhage and stab wounds to the chest.
About 400 hours of CCTV footage was reviewed during the investigation and officers were able to identify the bicycle used by Shah during the attack and track his movements to an area around St Francis Way.
During door-to-door enquiries on 6 November the bike was discovered in the area and Shah was arrested inside a flat by police.
A mobile phone was also found at the flat and officers discovered that less than an hour before the killing Shah robbed a partially sighted man in his 50s in Harold Road, Upton Park.

480,"The hackers - who are believed to be Russian - published emails belonging to a Usada staff member on Thursday.
""This is just another desperate attempt to distract from the real issue of state-sponsored doping,"" said Tygart.
In July, the McClaren report documented Russian doping in Olympic sports.
It outlined a state-backed scheme and led to more than 100 Russian athletes being banned from the Rio 2016 Games, while all Russians were banned from the subsequent Paralympic Games.
Since then the Fancy Bears, who describe themselves as a global hacking team, have released the medical records of some of the world's biggest sports stars, stolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) database.
They claim they want to highlight doping and are fighting for clean sport.
Most records released belonged to athletes who had been given permission by anti-doping agencies to take otherwise banned substances to treat medical conditions.
The latest releases on Thursday were emails which detailed more athletes who have been given therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which allow banned substances to be taken for athletes' verified medical needs.
But Tygart said Fancy Bears were trying to ""smear the reputations of athletes and organisations from around the world who choose to operate with integrity and abide by the rules"".
""They are con artists,"" the Usada CEO told BBC Sport. ""We are confident that people will see this for what it is: a malicious and illegal invasion of athlete privacy followed by a baseless smear campaign.""
Russian officials have denied that the state has anything to do with Fancy Bears.
Usada also highlighted to BBC Sport errors in the latest release by the hackers.
In one example, Fancy Bears claim the organisation ""granted"" 583 TUEs in 2015 but the accompanying image of a table details that number of applications being ""received"" by Usada.
Usada's 2015 annual report says 402 TUE applications were granted.
Usada is confident the hackers have not breached their security and is working with law enforcement at the highest level in the US to protect athletes it feels have become victims.
The leaks have been criticised by anti-doping officials and sports bodies, who say the TUE system is an accepted part of sport which is strictly governed.
However, critics have said the leaks raise important questions about the widespread use of TUEs and whether they should be allowed in sport.","US Anti-Doping Agency head Travis Tygart has called cyber-espionage team Fancy Bears ""con artists"" after they released documents allegedly showing ""cover ups"" by US sports officials."

The Cube opened in November 2010, but it had issues, which included a leaking roof.
Building inspectors said the helical staircase was ""dangerous, like a helter skelter""  and it was described by the then Conservative opposition leader David Sims as a ""poorly managed, waste of taxpayers' money"".
Work to bring it up to scratch has now been completed, the council said.
Mr Beattie said: ""We know it's taken a while, but we've got a building which is functional, people have got used to it and it makes a statement about Corby's ambition.
""As you see the developments taking place around the town centre, I don't think any of that would have happened without this building being here - it's acted as a magnet to attract further business.""
Rob McKellar, current Conservative opposition leader, said: ""The Cube is a building Corby can be proud of and it represents Corby's ambitions.

482,"College budgets are not protected and might be vulnerable to cuts in the 2015 Spending Review, says the party.
The analysis comes as further education members of the University and College Union strike over pay.
The government says it is determined young people should have funding to ""enjoy high-quality courses"".
Chancellor George Osborne has asked government departments to come up with savings plans for 25% and 40% of their budget ahead of the Spending Review on 25 November.
Labour commissioned researchers at the House of Commons library to model the effect of a 25% cut on college budgets.
The researchers used last year's budgets, updated to this year's prices, to calculate that savings of 25% would amount to £1.625bn from a total budget of £6.5bn.
Almost three-quarters of the money goes to further education colleges, so if the cut fell proportionally FE colleges would lose £1.173bn and sixth-form colleges £451m overall, say the researchers.
According to the calculations this could mean the closure of 80 FE colleges and 56 sixth-form colleges - a total of 136 or 40% of the 335 colleges, says Labour.
Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said the government was ""putting post-16 education on a cliff edge, harming opportunities for the next generation and holding our young people and our country back"".
""It is simply not possible to build a 21st-Century economy on falling investment in education,"" Ms Powell argued, saying Labour would have protected the whole education budget from cuts.
James Kewin, deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, called the analysis ""deeply worrying"".
It ""confirms our fears that some sixth-form colleges could be wiped from the educational map after the Spending Review.
""Funding for 16- to 19-year-olds, already significantly lower than for younger students, has been cut three times since 2011 and it seems certain that further reductions will be made next year.""
FE college staff, striking over a pay freeze, say they have suffered a real-terms cut of more than 17% over five years.
University and College Union general secretary Sally Hunt said she feared for the future of the sector.
""Colleges need stable investment to continue to help people of all backgrounds fulfil their potential,"" she said.
The Association of Colleges said the pay freeze reflected ""stringent financial circumstances in the sector"".
Colleges ""simply cannot take more cuts"", said chief executive Martin Doel.
Mr Doel urged the government to fund post-16 education at the same level as education for younger students, ""to ensure adult skills training does not become a thing of the past"".
The government announced area-based reviews of post-16 education and training in the summer, aiming to streamline spending.
""We need to move towards fewer, larger, more resilient and efficient colleges,"" wrote Skills Minister Nick Boles in guidance.
A Department for Education spokesman did not directly address Labour's figures but reiterated that the government was ""reforming further education to give employers and local authorities a greater say over how and what young people are taught so that training meets local labour market needs, while ensuring the best return on investment for public funding"".
""We are determined that post-16 providers have the resources they need to ensure young people in further education can enjoy high quality courses.""","Up to four in 10 further education and sixth-form colleges in England could close if the government presses ahead with savings, says Labour."

Mr Jones visited the village, also hit by flooding over Christmas, in January - a week after residents complained they had been left waiting for him after he had driven through the village without stopping.
He apologised but said he did not know they had been expecting him.
Visiting the Traffic Management Centre in Conwy on Thursday, he said: ""When I saw the flooding on the A55 and then met residents of Tal-y-Bont who had been affected, I said that the money was available for a flood alleviation scheme to help reduce the risk of it happening again.

In Friday's tweets, Mr Trump lambasted ""Obstructionist Democrats"" for hindering his security plans, which appeared to refer to legal efforts to block his travel ban in US courts.
On Thursday, Mr Trump condemned the attack in Spain before he urged his Twitter followers to look into General John Pershing's actions during the US war in the Philippines in the early 1900s.
According to the debunked myth, the US commander rounded up 50 terrorists and ordered his men to shoot 49 of them, using bullets dipped in pig's blood. Pigs are considered ritually unclean in Islam. It is claimed the survivor was told to go back and tell his people what happened.
However, historians and fact checkers say there is no truth to the story.
Mr Trump has faced sharp criticism for his inconsistent response to terrorist attacks and hate crimes.
Earlier this week, he declined to label the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, a terror attack after the Justice Department announced it was investigating it as an act of terror.

Brazil has the largest known outbreak of Zika, which has been linked to a sharp spike in birth defects.
Mr Castro also announced extra funds to speed up finding a vaccine for Zika.
He said that the goal was to develop a vaccine ""in record time"".
At the moment the only way to fight Zika is to clear standing water where mosquitoes breed.
The aim is that the tests will speed up diagnosis and ensure patients get correct medical treatment fast.
Since October around 3,530 babies have been born with microencephaly, which can lead to small heads and under-developed brains.
Fewer than 150 cases of microencephaly were seen in Brazil throughout 2014.
The US  State Department confirmed its first case of a baby born with brain damage because of infection by the Zika virus.
The baby was born in a hospital in Oahu, Hawaii.
The Hawaii State Department of Health said the mother was believed to have contracted Zika while living in Brazil in May 2015 and that the baby was most likely infected in the womb.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert on Friday advising pregnant women to avoid travelling to Brazil and other Latin American and Caribbean countries where outbreaks of Zika have been registered.
The travel alert applies to Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela and Puerto Rico.

He said Labour did not have election policies to ""rebalance both the economy and the political system"".

He laid out plans to transfer powers on housing, planning, transport and policing.
Lord Mandelson said Labour's proposals had not been ""radical enough"".
""We stepped back and passed the ball to the Conservatives and the coalition,"" he told BBC's Sunday Politics North West.
""And what did they do? They ran with it... and it was a strong part of their appeal both in the North West but also nationally.
""And the Labour Party, I'm afraid, has a long way to catch up. But catch up, it must do.""
He added: ""I think George Osborne got it.  I think he got it because he saw an electoral advantage in it... and we let him do so. And that was a huge political mistake.""
Lord Mandelson, a key figure in the governments of former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, is currently running for the position of University of Manchester chancellor.
He has been nominated alongside writer Lemn Sissay and Sir Mark Elder from the HallÃ© Orchestra.
Lord Mandelson said he wanted the post ""because the city of Manchester is becoming the most exciting, edgy place to be around in England"".
""Let's be honest, something very exciting is happening in this region as part of the Northern Powerhouse.""
The new chancellor will be announced on 22 June.

During the General Election campaign Labour told voters its policies on devolution were more radical than George Osborne's ""Northern Powerhouse"".
But the trouble was nobody could point to a coherent strategy.
Lord Mandelson has become the first senior Labour Party figure to admit it simply did not exist.
The former business secretary was clearly frustrated policies he began to formulate in government were not developed by Labour in opposition.
He clearly believes the party handed a political advantage to the Tories, something he describes as ""a huge political mistake"".
No wonder so many North West council leaders have been willing to work collaboratively with the government, despite the substantial cuts they have endured.

It was taken down from display when the Museum of Zoology closed in 2013 for a Â£4m makeover.
Re-assembling and re-hanging the whale took two people about four weeks.
The finback (Balaeonoptera physalus) - the second largest species after the blue whale - is thought to have weighed about 80 tonnes, the equivalent of eight double-decker buses, when it was alive.

It washed up in Pevensey Bay on 14 November, 1865, after a storm.
The mammal was sold at auction for Â£38 to 10 local fisherman who cut it up under the guidance of William Henry Flower, conservator of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.
Mr Flower told Cambridge University about the ""magnificent skeleton"", and the department bought it, finally putting it on public display 30 years later.
For years it took centre-stage, dwarfing the museum's four million other specimens, including the skeleton of a Dodo and many animals collected by naturalist Charles Darwin.
However, it was consigned to storage boxes for three years until being put back together and re-hung in a new glass display area.
Putting it back together took ""a lot of patience, a lot of effort and a lot of labour"", collections manager Matt Lowe said.

489,"The National Audit Office found the General Practice Extraction Service had cost Â£40m to set up instead of Â£14m.
The system was meant to make data from GP systems in England available to bodies across the health service.
But the system has provided information to just one organisation - NHS England.
The NAO said in its current form, it was ""unlikely"" the system could deliver what it was set up for.
The idea was to create a system that could help gather information from GP surgeries, such as the number of patients being diagnosed with dementia or getting immunised, to help with research and monitoring.
It also provides information to determine how much doctors are paid.
As well as finding that GPES had run over budget, the National Audit Office also said it was delivered late.
The original plan was for the service to be up and running by 2010, but in the end it was not until April last year that data was sent to the first customer, NHS England, which has since used it a number of times.
However, no universities, academics or other organisations have been given data, mainly because of the time taken to extract it.
A spokeswoman for the Health and Social Care Information Service, which runs the system, said: ""It is clear the procurement and design stage was not good enough.""

By 16:00 GMT on Saturday the term 'Chelsea' had been tweeted 578,000 times - the leading worldwide trend - while there were roughly 200,000 tweets sent containing the term 'Mourinho' between midday and 15:00 GMT.
Golf's world number three Rory McIlroy simply posted, #TaxiforJose. Within three hours it had been re-tweeted more than 2,000 times, gaining traction as far afield as Melbourne and Jakarta.
Popular YouTube personality and West Ham fan Spencer Owen wrote: ""Chelsea should have got rid of Mourinho weeks ago before Big Sam joined Sunderland! He was their best chance of staying up this season!""
Meanwhile, cartoonist Omar Momani was quick to link a Halloween nightmare as he depicted Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp arriving at Mourinho's home.
Everton fan Andy tweeted: ""Poor Jose, he was just fully committed to being Brendan Rodgers for Halloween, and now he's going to lose his job over it.""
And Twitter user Kobi the Key opted for some lyrics from the 2003 R Kelly hit 'Ignition'. His adapted lyrics read: ""It's the remix to ignition. The Mourinho Edition. Bought Falcao to spite Man U. Now I'm in 15th Position.""
Popular website Bleacher Report simply used the following image along with the words: ""Chelsea FC—The Sinking Bus.""
Of course, after such a humbling defeat, with a pack of baying journalists ready to fire questions, Mourinho's post-match news conference suddenly became a must-see event.
In it, the 52-year-old - charged by the Football Association with misconduct earlier in the week - refused to answer questions about key incidents in the game on the basis he may be punished again.

Howman said sport's increasing profitability had led to young athletes becoming more ""vulnerable"".
Drug testing is limited in non-elite events, and Howman admits teenagers are ""under the radar"" of doping agencies.
He also said doping could become a criminal offence in five years.
Howman said Wada's estimation of the level of cheating varied between sports.
""We have some guestimates based on some research undertaken over the last years,"" he told BBC's Hardtalk.
""It's far more than we would wish it to be - over 10%. That is of concern because those being caught by the system is far lower than that. Not in all sports, in some sports.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""The area of most concern for us is the level of young athletes who have not broken through into the elite who are trying to get that breakthrough and are susceptible to taking drugs because that's a shortcut.
""Not only are they susceptible to taking drugs, they are being encouraged to do so by any one of a number of people that surround them - coaches, trainers, even parents - because it's way to make a lot of money.""
Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha, 16, was stripped of her gold medal after failing a drugs test at last year's Commonwealth Games.
Former Wada president Dick Pound has previously said that four out of five cheats are not being caught.
And Howman said he was concerned there might still be riders doping at this year's Tour de France after former winner Lance Armstrong was stripped of seven titles following his admission he took performance-enhancing drugs.
Leader Chris Froome has been questioned about his performance during this year's race but the Team Sky rider has always denied doping.
Howman said the numbers of riders doping had fallen ""majorly"" since Armstrong won Tours from 1999 to 2005, adding: ""I have great respect for the way in which the UCI [world cycling's governing body] are now running their anti-doping programme.""
Regarding other sports, Howman said: ""Significant ground has been made to make sure the clean athlete achieves a level playing field.""
American sprinter Justin Gatlin is due to compete in next month's World Championships following two previous doping bans.
Asked whether he knew some of the world's top athletes were cheats, Howman said: ""Not to the same level as the information we had on Lance Armstrong but certainly we have information that is being investigated about a number of athletes around the world.""
Howman, who is to step down in 2016 after 12 years at Wada, admitted his organisation's effectiveness was limited by a lack of resources.
""When I started at Wada, Wayne Rooney was being paid $4m a year by Manchester United,"" Howman added. ""He's now being paid something like $30m.
""We were getting $20m when he first started, we're now getting $30m. Sport is saying to us [your money] should be increased but they are not doing it in the same proportion.
""That probably is not a good way of addressing the issue.""","More than 10% of elite athletes could be using performance-enhancing drugs, says World Anti-Doping Agency director general David Howman."

The situation has been magnified by pollution limits requiring a special fuel blend during the summer.
Officials insisted California was not running out of petrol, and one refinery has already resumed production.
The refinery had gone offline because of a power cut, exacerbating the supply problems.
""People may not find gas at a price that they like and there may be some stations where they used to get it that they can't, but our analysis says there is enough gasoline to meet demand,"" Alison Roberts, a spokeswoman with the California Energy Commission (CEC), told Reuters news agency.
Fuel price spikes particularly affect the state's independent petrol station operators, who pay a higher price for their supplies than some national chains.
Some have closed down their pumps rather than cut into profit margins. Costco, a giant discount store chain that sells large volumes of petrol, closed 14 of its 40 Los Angeles-area stations. Five were expected to reopen on Friday.
As prices increased over the past week, the California Independent Oil Marketers Association requested a waiver from the state's air board requesting to use the so-called winter-blend before the scheduled 1 November switchover.

Petrol prices are still relatively high around the US, averaging $3.79 a gallon, 39 cents higher than this time last year, according to the American Automobile Association.

The number of assaults average at eight per school day in Wales, which the union said was ""a great concern"".
It said they needed to be considered by schools, councils and the Welsh Government.
The Welsh Government has been asked to comment.
One teacher, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC Wales he was punched by a teenage pupil as he tried to stop a fight in his classroom.
The teacher, who has more than 20 years experience in the classroom, has spent more than six months on sick leave.
""I was punched in the face, it was a really violent incident,"" he said.
""It was like an out of body experience. You think, is this really happening?
""I was in shock. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion.""
NUT Cymru secretary David Evans said: ""Clearly any incidents of physical or verbal assault by pupils towards teachers or any members of the school staff are unacceptable.
""The details of the FOI do not cover the severity of these assaults but of course we can only assume that they were notable enough to warrant school staff to feel the need to report them.""
Pembrokeshire council recorded the highest number of incidents by far - 1,268 over three academic years.
Of these, 1,268 were physical and 77 verbal.
A spokesman said councils had varying approaches to the reporting of violent incidents and comparing figures from different areas could be misleading.
He said the council had been ""particularly robust in improving its recording and logging of physical and verbal violence against staff in its schools in order to give a true picture of the situation"".
The council said this ensured that the staff received the best possible support.
It added that many of the incidents took place in the authority's specialist education units rather than in its mainstream schools.
Union officials said the real number of attacks in Wales could be much higher.
NUT Cymru has also questioned how different local authorities recorded the incidents.
""It does beg the question why there isn't a more standard approach to monitoring which would help in terms of putting in place policies and training to reduce the impact it may have,"" Mr Evans added.
The union said assaults not only had an impact on individual teachers but disrupted the classroom environment.
Cardiff head teacher Jason Clark has faced verbal abuse from a pupil and even a physical assault by a parent.

Ipswich Crown Court heard George-Hari Constantinescu and Danut Gheorghe, both 30, had prowled the streets for almost an hour before they attacked her.
The pair denied the charge but were found guilty following a trial.
Updates on this story and other Suffolk news
In a statement read at court, the victim said she still has nightmares about the attack and now lives in fear.
Sentencing, Judge Rupert Overbury described the men as ""predators"" and said their actions were ""callous"".
He said every woman should be able to ""walk in every street, in every town, without the fear of being attacked"".
The court heard the men had decided to have sexual activity with a woman ""whether or not she accepted"" that night.
When their advances had failed in clubs and venues around the town, they then spent 50 minutes trawling Ipswich looking for a young woman, it was heard.
They spotted their victim and ""hunted her"", attacking her when she was walking along Rope Walk between 03:10 and 03:30 GMT.
Constantinescu and Gheorghe grabbed her, covered her mouth and dragged her into a nearby car park.
They used what the judge described as ""unnecessary violence"" on the victim, who fell unconscious during the attack which lasted several minutes.
Constantinescu and Gheorghe abandoned her, leaving her half naked and with significant injuries to her face and neck which required hospital treatment.
The court heard they attempted to evade CCTV cameras on their way back into town, and in the days after they attempted to change their appearance and looked at flights to flee the country.
The pair were arrested after Suffolk Constabulary released CCTV images.","Two ""predators"" who attempted to rape a woman in an attack which left her unconscious have been jailed for 12 years."
504,"Recent hacked emails are ""consistent with the methods and motivation of Russia-directed efforts"", the Department of Homeland Security said.
Data revealing discussions within the Democratic Party was hacked earlier this year.
Some states reported ""probing"" attempts made on ""election-related"" systems.
However, officials said those attempts could not be directly linked to the Russian government.
Russian officials told Interfax news agency the claims it was involved in the cyber attacks were ""nonsense"".
But a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security said high-ranking officials at the Kremlin were almost certainly involved in the successful attacks.
""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" they said.
However, altering any actual ballots or election results would be ""extremely difficult"", they added, because of a decentralised system and multiple checks and balances.
A number of embarrassing emails have come to light during the 2016 election campaign.
In July, a hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for the release of documents from the Democratic Party.
Gigabytes of files including emails and other documents that revealed the inner workings of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were taken.
At an early stage, many US officials linked the breach to Russia. At the time, Moscow denied any involvement and denounced the ""poisonous anti-Russian"" rhetoric from Washington.
The leaked emails appeared to show that Democratic Party officials were biased against Bernie Sanders in his primary race against Mrs Clinton.
The hack led to the resignation of the party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and sparked protests at the national convention in Philadelphia.
Adam Schiff, a senior member of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said he applauded the decision to publicly name Russia as the culprit.
""All of us should be gravely concerned when a foreign power like Russia seeks to undermine our democratic institutions,"" he said.
He called for co-operation with ""our European allies"" to develop a response.","US officials have formally accused Russia of cyber attacks against political organisations in order ""to interfere with the US election""."

Colonel Richard Kemp, the former British army commander in Afghanistan, shared his tribute to his great uncle Second lieutenant Philip Duncan, who was killed in the battle.
2nd Lt Philip Duncan was killed in action near Poelcapelle in Belgium during the Second Battle of Passchendaele on 30 October 1917 at the age of 26.
He died leading his men in battle just 21 days after joining his battalion on the Western Front.
Matt Pitcher remembered his great-grandfather, Sergeant William John Timbley, fought in the battle and survived to tell his story.
Matt told the BBC his great-grandfather was a career solider with the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards. He turned 38 a month before the first battle of Passchendaele and saw action in the Boesinghe sector in Poelcapelle.
Before he fought in the battle, he was one of just 200 men who survived the first Battle of Ypres in 1914. After the war, he didn't speak of his time in the army.
Sam Barnett's also posted about his great-grandfather, Private Maurice Walter Barnett, who was killed in the opening attack of the battle on 31 July 1917.
Private Barnett served in the 12th Battalion Royal Sussex Regiment after a spell at the 9th Battalion. ""It is hard to imagine what he went through, surviving Boar's Head and the Battle of the Somme,"" said Sam.
""It's easy for us to think of the casualties as just numbers of soldiers but, to Walter, they would have been his local shopkeepers, neighbours, and friends.""
Russell Craig tweeted an image in remembrance of his great uncle, Private James Kelly, who was killed in the battle on 16 August 1917.
Kelly was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1897. He attempted to sign up for service with local military units, but he was rejected so he went to Randalstown in Ireland to enlist with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.
His body was never recovered. His name is commemorated in Tyne Cot Cemetery alongside 35,000 other missing soldiers.
Paul Brown shared the story of his great-grandfather, Richardson Robson Flinn. He served with the Northumberland Fusiliers Labour Corps in 1914, then aged 22.
He was gassed during fighting in 1915 and recuperated in Britain before going back to the frontline at Passchendaele.
""Richardson made it almost to the German lines before being felled by gunfire, and lay wounded in a shell hole,"" said Paul.
""Once the initial chaos had subsided, German officers emerged waving red cross flags. One German gave Richardson some water from his canteen. Eventually, the wounded from both sides were evacuated.
""Richardson was discharged in December 1917 with a disability shot wound, although it was the gas that had done the worst damage.
""He returned home, but never fully recovered his health, and died young. Unfortunately, none of his living relatives ever got the chance to know him.""
Twitter user @DaveVForce shared his memory of his distant cousin who was killed in the battle.
Gunner William Potterton enlisted for service on 11 July 1916 and served with the 72nd battery Royal Field Artillery.

Other Boscombe players then conceded.
It meant Waverley retained the men's county champions title.
Waverley secretary Peter Aldridge said both clubs were ""mortified by the behaviour"".
He said he had been told by members who were present that the player, in his 30s, was hurt after the argument blew up during the final and a headbutt was attempted.
Mr Aldridge said: ""Bowls has changed over the years - people do get excited but this was not acceptable.
""It doesn't represent the attitude of Boscombe Cliff and is not representative of the game.""
Boscombe Cliff Bowls Club has declined to comment.
The sport's governing body in the county, Bowls Hampshire, confirmed there was an incident which resulted in a Boscombe player being ""asked to leave the green"" and the team conceding the match.

""This sentence is a big surprise to me as I did not nothing wrong,"" Sigurjon Arnason told Reuters.
The former chief executives of Iceland's two other big banks, Glitnir and Kaupthing, have already received jail sentences.
The three banks imploded in 2008 after acquiring assets worth approximately 10 times the size of Iceland's economy.
A Reykjavik court said that nine months of Mr Arnason's sentence would be suspended.
Two of his colleagues - Ivar Gudjonsson, a former director of proprietary trading, and Julius Heidarsson, a banker - were also convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison, of which six months would be suspended.
Unlike other Western countries, Iceland has pursued prison sentences for the chief executives and others who were involved in the 2008 financial crisis.
Hreidar Mar Sigurdsson, the former chief executive of Kaupthing - formerly Iceland's largest bank - received a jail sentence of five and a half years - the heaviest sentence for financial fraud in Iceland's history.

""But I think over a long period, the players that keep working hard will eventually get success in the team.""
It is an altogether different dynamic than that which faced the midfielder in the Highlands, where he proved one of John Hughes' pivotal players.
""That was one of the things I thought about when I moved,"" Christie told BBC Scotland. ""I wasn't going to be straight into the starting 11; I had to almost start from scratch again.
""But I'm delighted I've eventually started making appearances on the park.""
Celtic recovered from a shaky first half at Parkhead to put Caley Thistle to the sword 3-0 after the break
""It was very strange playing against old team mates,"" said Christie. ""Nice to see them again and I wish them all the best in the future. I spent many good years at Inverness, but it's time to move on now.
""First half, fair credit to Inverness, I think they passed the ball excellently and shocked us a bit. We regrouped a bit at half-time and showed we were definitely the better team.

511,"At countless UN climate meetings, Mr De Brum was a passionate champion of the rights of small island states.
He was instrumental in securing the ""high ambition coalition"" of rich and poor countries that was pivotal to a deal in the French capital.
Mr De Brum died at his home in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands.
Born near the end of WWII, Mr De Brum grew up in an era when the tiny Pacific state was being used to host a number of US nuclear bomb tests.
When he was nine years old he witnessed one such detonation, while fishing with his grandfather around 200 miles away.
The resulting destruction of the atolls, the evacuation of many islanders as a result of the atomic tests became a hotly contested political issue. The islander's push for independence and compensation played a large part in Tony De Brum's political awakening.
As one of the Islands' first university graduates, Mr De Brum was heavily involved in the negotiations with the US that resulted in an agreement on independence and compensation signed in 1986.
However it was the threat of rising seas and a changing climate became the key issues of his time as a Marshall Islands foreign minister.
In the Paris climate negotiations, his warm, personal and relaxed style was very much in contrast to the stiffer, greyer faces of some teams.
He used his charm to build strong personal relationships with many of the political leaders from rich and poor countries alike.
This helped create the ""coalition of high ambition,"" a group that ultimately involved around 100 nations, including the US, the EU, African, Caribbean and island states.
This alliance of rich and poor proved critical in pushing the deal through.
The biggest win from Mr De Brum's perspective, was that the Paris agreement committed to  the goal of keeping global temperature increases close to 1.5C - ""1.5 to stay alive,"" was a phrase often used by Mr De Brum.
Tributes to the former minister have been led by the Marshall Islands' President Hilda Heine.
""The very existence of the Paris Climate Agreement owes a lot to Tony De Brum,"" she wrote in a statement.
""He was a giant of history, a legend in every meaning of the world and a custodian of our shared future.""

The rarely seen journals will eventually be included in the static Trincomalee exhibition in Hartlepool.
One journal dates from 1852 and was kept by midshipman William Dawson. It contains a detailed log and tracking maps of the journeys that HMS Trincomalee took during that period.

The government will publish draft legislation next month and ministers said the charge would be brought in by the end of the current parliament at the latest.
The amount of the charge would depend on the size of the vehicle and is expected to raise a total of £20m a year.

522,"The party said Geoffrey Clark, who is standing for Kent County Council, would not be a UKIP councillor if elected.
Mr Clark said on his website he did not endorse the abortion idea but suggested it to cut the national debt.
Learning disability charity Mencap said it was disgusted and horrified at Mr Clark's personal manifesto.
UKIP said Thursday's ballot paper would still list him as its candidate but, pending an investigation, he would not be a UKIP councillor.
Chartered accountant Mr Clark, 66, who is also standing for Meopham North ward on Gravesham Borough Council in Thursday's by-election, says on his website his comments are personal and do not reflect UKIP policy.
He calls for a national debate and an urgent government review of the NHS, which he says ""risks becoming unaffordable in the future"".
The review should look at ""compulsory abortion when the foetus is detected as having Down's, spina bifida or similar syndrome which, if it is born, could render the child a burden on the state as well as on the family"".
He says the review should also look at medical treatment for those aged over 80, ""which is disproportionately costly to the NHS"" and might also include ""legalising euthanasia and giving free euthanasia advice to all folk over 80"".
He told the BBC: ""I don't intend to offend.
""What I am trying to do is to provoke a debate in the nation because I am so disenchanted with our politicians.""
Mark Goldring, chief executive of Mencap, said: ""Much has been written about the Paralympics this summer changing attitudes towards disabled people for the better.
""Yet in the very same year, a council candidate has proposed forced eugenics against disabled people.
""It is abhorrent that Geoffrey Clark sees disabled people solely as a burden when people with a learning disability lead full lives and make valuable contributions to their communities and families.
""We question if he is fit for public office.""
Mr Clark, who describes himself as a member of Meopham Parochial Church Council, Rotary International, the Royal British Legion and the Youth Hostels Association, says population, immigration and threats to the green belt are linked issues close to his heart.
If elected, he promises to promote the Christian ethic and British culture, roll back Islam, contain UK population growth and restrict immigration.
A UKIP spokesman said the party rejected Mr Clark's ""abhorrent"" views.
""The party was not aware of these views when it allowed him to stand under our name,"" he said.
""Mr Clark has been formally suspended as a UKIP candidate and will not be standing for the party again.
""We would like to apologise to anyone who has suffered distress as a result of this matter.""",A UKIP candidate who called for an NHS review to look at compulsory abortion of foetuses with Down's syndrome or spina bifida has been suspended.

Mr Gill was responding to suggestions that former  Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless were set to be imposed as candidates by the party centrally.
""As a principle, I think that it's madness to have people standing who the local party don't want to stand for them.
""Which is why the local party will now decide who represents them,"" he said.
He said the upcoming elections give the party a chance to show they can be disciplined and do ""good things for the people of Wales"".

524,"Willie Cameron, who runs a range of hospitality businesses in the Highlands, believes the fact that the pound tanked against the Euro following the EU referendum has benefited the sector in the short-term.
But its long-term repercussions are more uncertain.
A recent survey suggested that more than a quarter of EU nationals - normally the most loyal and lucrative visitors - would be less likely to holiday here because of the vote to leave.
Mr Cameron said: ""In the short term it's extremely good as far as the tourism industry is concerned.
""However, in the long term we don't know what's going to happen and this is where the big question mark regarding tourism generally is concerned - we're entering very, very uncertain times.""
Any potential investment in the industry is being ""put on the back burner"", he added.
""There are no decisions being made, there's no indication of decisions being made, it is very worrying.""
Part of that uncertainty surrounds the attitude of potential EU visitors. Would they really turn their backs on the UK as a holiday destination as a recent poll suggests?
Simon Calder, travel editor of The Independent, said: ""It is not unreasonable for people on the continent to feel a bit miffed with the result of the EU vote.
""Effectively we were saying, 'We don't want to play' and therefore, of course, there will be a number of people who will say, 'Right, well if you don't want to be part of our great economic experiment, then we don't want to come on holiday to your country'.
""I think a bigger worry, actually, are people who will infer for some reason - maybe all the rhetoric that was going on at the time of the referendum - that somehow they'll need a visa to come to Scotland.
""It's very unlikely that the traditional Scottish markets will need that but it might deter some people.""
The numbers of tourists coming to Scotland's shores is just one side of the coin.
Increasingly, the staff serving them in the cafes and making the beds in the hotels are from other EU states, especially eastern and central Europe.
Restaurant worker Erik Harrmann, from the Czech Republic, said he was shocked and baffled by the Brexit vote.
""I was surprised. We all thought that Britain would remain. Yes, it was like shock for us, for all of us,"" he said.
His colleague, Julie Barbusinova, added: ""I was so sad. Everybody was sad in work.""
Many observers reckon foreign seasonal workers are the backbone of the tourist industry here.
George Stone runs a programme which has brought hundreds into the Highlands in recent years and he has real concerns about what might happen if there is a hard-line approach to such immigration.
""They form a huge part of the workforce in the hotels,"" he said.
""And it's not just in the unskilled jobs that don't require a language, but the waitresses and, to an increasing extent, the people in the kitchen, not just washing the dishes but preparing the meals, are coming from Europe, particularly the central European countries.
""There are going to be two sets of losers. First of all, the young, dynamic people from places like the Czech Republic but also my friends, the hotel owners and managers here in the north of Scotland.
""It will be difficult for them to replace the staff from other sources.""
The Scottish tourist trade is just one sector still trying to find out what exactly Brexit will mean for them.","Hotels, restaurants and historic attractions in the north of Scotland have just enjoyed a bumper season - but there is uncertainty about the future of the tourism industry following the Brexit vote."

It's calling on NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups to drive the initiative forward.
In Dorset, doctors already prescribe walks, conservation work, gardening and sailing.
East Riding of Yorkshire Council has developed an IT system which links up GPs with leisure centres so they can book patients directly on to exercise plans.
The LGA, which took on responsibility for public health under the recent NHS shake-up, says exercise prescriptions would encourage people to be more active, lose weight and keep fit.
Spokeswoman Izzi Seccombe said: ""There are some instances where rather than prescribing a pill, advising on some type of moderate physical activity outdoors could be far more beneficial to the patient.
""There are already some good examples where this is being piloted in the UK and it is something we should consider on a nationwide basis.""
The Royal College of General Practitioners said any decision to invest in social prescribing schemes, and roll them out more widely, must not be an alternative to investing in general practice services.
Spokesman Dr Steve Mowle said: ""Social prescribing schemes can certainly be beneficial to a patient's overall health and wellbeing - as some pilots have shown - but to be effective, there needs to be better integration between health and community services, so that GPs and our teams can signpost our patients most appropriately.""

528,"Malcolm Roberts, from the far-right party One Nation, said he was ""very confident"" he could prove he was not a dual citizen.
Under Australia's constitution, a person cannot run for federal office if they hold dual or plural citizenship.
Three politicians have quit as a row over dual citizenship has intensified.
The Queensland senator, who was born in India to a Welsh father, said he never believed he was British citizen.
Speaking in a television interview with Sky News, Senator Roberts said he contacted British authorities days before the cut-off for candidate nominations.
He said he wrote three times to British authorities saying: ""I believe I am not a British and just in case though, if I am, then I renounce it effective immediately.""
Senator Roberts said he received formal registration of his status from British authorities on December 5, 2016 - five months after the federal election.
""I've taken all steps that I reasonably believe necessary,"" Senator Roberts told Sky News.
The senator has previously confirmed on social media that he was not an Indian citizen.
""I am a citizen only of Australia and therefore eligible to hold the position as Senator in the Australian parliament,"" he said on Facebook.
The politician has been under pressure to reveal his status following the resignation of two deputy Greens leaders, Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters, who were both dual nationals.
This week, Matthew Canavan also quit as Australia's Minister for Resources and Northern Australia because he faces legal questions over his Italian citizenship.
The Section 44 (Disqualification) states that any person who ""is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power... shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives"".
This is interpreted by the High Court of Australia as meaning that persons with dual citizenship are not permitted to run for office.
Yes. Dual nationals cannot be elected to parliament in Armenia, Egypt or the Philippines.

530,"Jacqueline Sauvage suffered decades of abuse and became a cause celebre, prompting a campaign for her release.
Mr Hollande issued a partial pardon at the end of January but the courts twice rejected applications for her release.
He has now given Ms Sauvage a complete pardon and she was freed from jail early on Wednesday evening.
Now aged 69, she had been serving a 10-year sentence at Reau prison, to the south-east of Paris.
""I've decided to grant Jacqueline Sauvage a pardon of the rest of her sentence. This pardon puts an immediate end to her detention,"" the president tweeted.
In a further statement from the Elysee Palace, he said he felt her place was with her family and not in jail.
A car carrying Ms Sauvage and her three daughters was seen leaving Reau prison soon afterwards.
Campaigners were overjoyed by the news. But Virginie Duval, the head of the French union of magistrates, complained that the president had acted ""to please public opinion"", pointing out that the judiciary had followed the law when it rejected Ms Sauvage's appeals.
Read more on the Sauvage case: Should presidents pardon?
In August, a local court rejected a plea for parole and its ruling was backed up last month by the court of appeal in Paris.
Ms Sauvage's daughters had fought for her release ever since she was jailed in 2014, insisting that she had been brutally treated throughout her marriage by her husband Norbert Marot. When her son committed suicide, she picked up a gun the following day and shot him.
Justifying its decision to reject her application for parole in August, the local court at Melun explained that Ms Sauvage had not done enough to show remorse.
She could not expect to live in an environment which, because of the media coverage of her case, ""would risk maintaining her in the position of victim"".
But Ms Sauvage's case attracted the support of 434,000 people who signed an internet petition as well as dozens of MPs, from both left and right.
It also secured the backing of President Hollande, who met her three daughters and gave her a partial pardon, which is part of the constitution but used very rarely.
His initial pardon in January was for her sentence to be reduced to a minimum, allowing for the judiciary to decide when she should be freed. His final decision called for her immediate release.",A French woman in her sixties who murdered her husband in 2012 has been released after a second intervention by President Francois Hollande.

533,"They are looking for chains of depressions known as catenae.
These would have formed when comets passed too close to the Sun and broke apart under tidal forces into many pieces, and then splattered the surface of the Solar System's innermost world.
The Open University team is examining pictures returned from the US space agency's (Nasa) Messenger probe.
This satellite, which is expected to end operations on Thursday with a crash of its own on to Mercury, has already revealed some extraordinary insights into the planet's past relationship with comets.
Many of the ices and other volatile compounds seen in permanently shadowed craters at the poles were most probably delivered by the frozen wanderers.
Likewise, the blackened hue of some surface deposits may indicate a dusting of carbon-rich material derived from comets that have hit Mercury.
Given its position so close to the Sun, one would expect the planet to have been pelted by the countless icy dirt-balls that routinely get drawn in to graze our star.
And tidally fragmented comets would have done so as a train of objects, having been dislocated in the Sun's immense gravity field.
Something very similar is seen out at Jupiter where comets that have got too close to the gas giant will crumble and then sequentially splatter its moons.
David Rothery and Emma Fegan have been poring over Messenger images, trying to determine how many of the 500 or so crater chains they have identified on Mercury are evidence of this same process of tidal disruption.
Many of the catenae are unarguably the result of debris that was flung out of primary impact bowls (dug out by intact colliding comets or asteroids).  These ejecta strings form radial patterns that can be traced back to an obvious source.
The chains Rothery and Fegan are attempting to distinguish, on the other hand, have no clear origin. They appear isolated.
And, intriguingly, when they plot the orientation of these suspect catenae, they appear to betray a bias. More seem to point north-south than east-west. If confirmed, this may say something about the early population of comets in the Solar System.
""It could be that we're seeing the north-south ones more easily because of the direction of sunlight, but these are pretty big features - kind of hard to miss,"" explained Prof Rothery.
""If there are genuinely more catenae orientated north-south than east-west, it's suggesting that if they're produced by tidally disrupted comets then the comets that were hitting Mercury more than three billion years ago had orbits tilted at more or less ninety degrees to the plane of Mercury's orbit.""
The idea is somewhat speculative at the moment, but fascinating nonetheless.
Although the image stream from Messenger is about to end, the next probe to Mercury is already under construction.
BepiColombo is a joint venture between the European and Japanese space agencies.
Its mission will launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit in 2024. Prof Rothery is the lead co-investigator on Bepi's Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS), which has been designed by a team at Leicester University.
He presented his and Fegan's catenae research at the recent European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria.

In October, Amnesty International raised concerns over ""war crimes"" by Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.
The UN said it was particularly worried about 1,300 Sunnis stranded in ""no-man's-land"" near Sinjar, between Kurdish security forces and IS.
""Reports indicate that Iraqi security forces and Kurdish security forces and their respected affiliated militias have been responsible for looting and destruction of property belonging to Sunni Arab communities, forced evictions, abductions, illegal detention and, in some cases, extrajudicial killings,"" UN spokeswoman Cecile Pouilly said.

""Economic woes"" of the local newspaper industry were ""not the BBC's fault"", he said during the WT Stead lecture.
""The classified advertising market has moved online"", he added.
Mr Harding said the drift of classified marketing from local papers to the internet had resulted in financial difficulties for the regional press.
""The local newspaper industry's problems lie with the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Gumtree, eBay and a long, long tail of others. I am acutely concerned by the pressures facing the local newspaper industry and we at the BBC will do anything to help,"" he said.
His remarks follow those made in November by Home Secretary Theresa May, who told the Society of Editors that the BBC had to think ""carefully"" about its local news service.
She said: ""Local newspapers are having a particularly hard time. That has partly been the result of the BBC's dominant position on the internet, and its ability to subsidise the provision of internet news using the licence fee.
""This makes it enormously difficult for local newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all the locally significant news, what is left to motivate the local reader to buy a paper?""
She added that the corporation was ""destroying local newspapers and it could eventually happen to national newspapers as well"".
Mr Harding, who previously edited The Times, said the BBC's regional bulletins attracted some of its largest audiences for news.
""We have a direct interest in the health of local newspapers and regional newsrooms,"" he said. ""We thrive thanks to vibrant public debate and courtesy of the stories and ideas unearthed by our colleagues in rival news organisations.""
But he added that the BBC's primary responsibility must be to ""serve licence fee payers"".
""They want and are entitled to the best possible local news services we can deliver,"" he said.
Following the recent scandal of executive payoffs and fallout from the dropped Newsnight investigation into Jimmy Savile, Mr Harding also spoke about the need to retain the trust placed in the BBC by the public.
""Trust is our most prized asset - and the key to our future,"" he said. ""It depends upon us striving, ceaselessly, to be fair, reliable and open to ideas.""
He stressed the BBC's ""uncompromising commitment to accuracy, impartiality, diversity of opinion and the decent treatment of people in the news"".
Commenting on the issue of press regulation, Mr Harding highlighted the need for a free and independent press.
""I worry when politicians and judges weigh in, "" he said, ""either frequently or eagerly, on the behaviour of journalists and news organisations.""
""At a time when our society needs curious, inquisitive journalism more than ever, I think we need to be extremely vigilant against encroachment on press freedom and freedom of expression,"" he added.","News director James Harding has spoken out against the ""mistaken view"" the BBC should ""rein in"" local news coverage for fear of damaging local newspapers."

""We now have a fantastic talent pool and will be able to keep it running for years and years because of the talent that is out there.""
The Lion King opened in 1999 in London and still plays to full houses at the Lyceum Theatre, 17 years on.
Several members of Dreamgirls' ensemble have appeared in the show there, or in other stagings of the Disney musical.
Freidman also cited the specific demands placed on the show's lead actress as another reason why Dreamgirls has taken so long to cross the Atlantic.
Dreamgirls tells of a black female singing trio, reminiscent of The Supremes, who fight to make their mark in '60s America.
The 2006 film, starring Beyonce and Eddie Murphy, was many Britons' first exposure to the Tony Award-winning show.
Jennifer Hudson won an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe for playing Effie White, the threesome's most gifted and volatile member.
The role - which Friedman says is like ""climbing Everest and doing a marathon at the same time"" for a performer - is played in London by Amber Riley.
Riley, best known for playing Meredith Jones in US TV show Glee, was in tears as she took her bows at end of Wednesday's opening night.
""Some nights it's like that,"" she told the BBC News website. ""I get so overwhelmed and caught up in the story.""
Riley, who is making her West End debut in the production, said the part of Effie was ""the role of a lifetime"".
""She starts really young and ballsy and she gets to be vulnerable, and then she gets to be an adult,"" the 30-year-old explained.
""I get to show her whole entire journey, and I've never really gotten to share that arc before.""
Reviews of the show have praised the US actress, with The Guardian describing her as ""a notch above... on a stage of great singers"".
Its critic Lyndsey Winship said that her ""huge and effortless voice... rips through the auditorium"".
""Without question, Riley is the biggest reason to buy a ticket,"" writes Dominic Cavendish in the Telegraph.
Casey Nicholaw's ""slick"" and ""tinselly"" production, he continues, offers ""tremendous gusto of soul and gaiety of spirit"".
The Mail's Quentin Letts says the show ""has great costumes and incessant dancing"" and is ""likely to be a hit"".
The Times' Ann Treneman, however, thinks ""it doesn't deserve to be"" one - as its plot is ""far too skimpy"" and its singing ""way too loud"".
Riley's Glee co-star Chris Colfer and comedian Sir Lenny Henry were among the audience at the Savoy Theatre on Wednesday.
Sir Lenny has been a vocal campaigner for more representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people in the broadcasting industry.

Dean McKelvey said, ""It is probably going to be the toughest sit-out yet both economically and weather-wise.""
The appeal raises money for various charities in Northern Ireland as well as Christian Aid.
This will be the last black santa sit-out for the Church of Ireland dean of Belfast, Rev Houston McKelvey, who announced he is to retire in April 2011.
Dean McKelvey said: ""We will be in the street as usual each day from Thursday to Christmas Eve from nine in the morning to five in the evening.

""I extend an invitation to everyone to come and see us or 'our day off' on Sunday 19 December, when  we will present ""Carols for the City"" and celebrate the Christmas message of God's generosity.
""I would like to sincerely thank those who have already responded to our Postal appeal.
""It helps going on to the street knowing that £90,000 has already been given to this year's appeal.""
Dean McKelvey plans to sit outside St Anne's Cathedral until Christmas Eve, continuing a tradition begun by his predecessors 30 years ago.
The charity vigil has raised millions since it began. Dean Sammy Crooks first started the collection in 1976.
Dean McKelvey first sat out for Christmas five years ago, following in the footsteps of his predecessor Dean Jack Shearer, who died in January 2001.

539,"Lenders reported that this was the third successive quarter of falling demand, the bank's Credit Conditions Survey found.
Mortgages for high-value property saw the biggest fall in demand since the third quarter of 2008.
Demand was expected to bounce back in the second quarter.
Some lenders attributed the fall in demand over recent quarters to a combination of changes in regulatory policy and concerns about housing affordability, as well as uncertainty about the outlook for the housing market.
However, the predicted recovery might point to the effect of the general election campaign on the UK housing market.
""For demand to have fallen particularly sharply at the upper end of the market underlines the sensitivity of this demographic to political uncertainty,"" said Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of Dragonfly Property Finance.
""Many prime and super-prime buyers are sitting on their hands and want to see what the next government looks like before they commit to a purchase. That this is the most uncertain election in decades has certainly triggered more caution at this level of the market than normal.""
The survey suggested that lenders were showing a greater willingness to lend to borrowers who were only able to offer a deposit of less than 10% of the property's value so far this year. Many of these borrowers would be first-time buyers.","Demand for mortgages fell sharply in the first quarter of the year in the UK, according to research for the Bank of England."

Traditionally, thousands of people gather on and around Magdalen Bridge to hear choristers sing hymns at dawn from the tower at Magdalen College.
The city and county councils and police have worked to ""ensure a safe"" event.
Last year, about 30 revellers ignored safety warnings and broke through barriers to jump from the bridge.
The water is shallow and the county council said the cost to the health service in 2005 was about Â£50,000.
Police urged people not to ""abuse"" the decision to allow pedestrians access this year.

Mr Michaels appeared at Torquay Magistrates' Court earlier and was remanded in custody.
He is due to appear at Exeter Crown Court on 18 August.
Police were called to a property off Hensford Road, Dawlish at 08:00 BST on Saturday, following reports of a man with a crossbow.

Youngsters James Kettleborough (71) and Ben Duckett (55) made half-centuries, backed by Adam Rossington (44) and Andrew Hall (43).
Home skipper Varun Chopra was on 43 as the Bears closed on 79-1 from 16 overs.
After the early loss of former captain Ian Westwood, Chopra has so far put on 70 for the second wicket with William Porterfield (24 not out).
After claiming maximum bowling points, the Bears must do the same with the bat on day two to try and close the gap on leaders Yorkshire, who are already in a strong position in their game against Nottinghamshire.
BBC Coventry & Warwickshire's Clive Eakin:
""In truth, Yorkshire's dominance at Trent Bridge is probably good news for Warwickshire.
""The Bears have privately accepted for a while that the title was Yorkshire's to lose but, if the Tykes beat Notts, it puts Warwickshire in a strong position to claim the decent prize money for second.
""Even though they put the bottom county in, this looks a decent pitch. Northants batted well in spells, with Adam Rossington especially pleasing on the eye, but 273 looks below par.
""The short boundary in front of the Eric Hollies Stand encourages brisk scoring and Warwickshire will look to push the game forward on the second day.""
BBC Radio Northampton's Chris Egerton:
""Northants began the day learning they are highly likely to miss out on signing Leicestershire's Josh Cobb and they ended it knowing a difficult two days are ahead.
""Despite battling strongly, 273 all out already looks likes being short of a par score and Northants' bowling will need to improve after conceding just short of five an over in the 16 overs possible.
""What is encouraging for Northants' members is that young players such as Adam Rossington (44), Ben Duckett (55) and James Kettleborough (71) are making runs at Division One level.

543,"Some 3,740 people died until 23 October, a number that is set to rise as the two worst months are yet to come. Last year's death toll was 3,771.
This comes despite a sharp decline on the number of people crossing the Mediterranean this year.
The UN believes smugglers are changing their tactics, using riskier routes.
One of every 47 migrants or refugees attempting the voyage between Libya and Italy is dying, said William Spindler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
""This is by far the worse we ever have seen in the Mediterranean,"" he told journalists in Geneva.
""We can say the death rate has increased threefold.""
There were 327,800 crossings this year, against more than one million in 2015, UN numbers showed.
Smugglers, the UN says, are organising more crossings in very bad weather and staging mass embarkations, in which thousands of people in flimsy boats set off at the same time.
This means that if they do run into trouble, rescue services cannot possibly save them all.
""Smuggling has become a big business, it's being done almost on an industrial scale,"" Mr Splinder added.
""So now they send several boats at the same time and that puts rescue services in difficulty because they need to rescue several thousand people on several hundred boats,"" he said.
An agreement between Turkey and the European Union to halt migrants from travelling to Greek islands has drastically reduced the number of boat arrivals there.
But there has been a traffic increase on the highly perilous journey between North Africa and Italy.
On Monday, the Italian coastguard said it recovered the bodies of 16 people during 21 rescue missions. Some 2,200 migrants were saved from 18 rubber boats.","This year is set to be the deadliest for migrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, the UN refugee agency says."

One of the highlights is a quadcopter called Zano. It's small enough to fit into your hand, but still powerful enough to film HD quality video.
No tech show would be complete without the latest 3D printers. Highlights include the latest in food printing and machines that can build detailed, multicoloured 3D objects like this below, just out of paper and ink.

545,"Once in the doldrums, production of the country's cocoa crop has risen sharply, registering a 10-fold increase since 2004.
Many of the small farmers, who were previously living on the edge of poverty, have seen a boost to their incomes.
The key to the success has been the development of farmers' co-operatives, which have allowed the farmers to cut out the middlemen who took a large chunk of the profits.
""My life is different now,"" says Jose Esperansa, a small-scale cocoa farmer, who is now the managing director of CECEAQ-11, a cocoa-fermenting, drying and exporting co-operative.
The initiative, supported by the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad) and Cafedirect, a British Fairtrade firm, has helped the co-operatives produce Fairtrade certified beans.
Sao Tome and Principe, a Portuguese colony until 1975, has an ideal climate and rich soils that are ideal for growing cocoa.
The crop was introduced in the 19th Century and cultivated by slaves brought from the African mainland, where they worked on plantations, known as rocas.
But by the late 1990s, the crop was in severe decline, partly because of a crash in the price of the commodity.
The results were crippling, since cocoa made up 95% of the island's exports.
Farmers lost faith in cocoa as a source of income and one politician even predicted the end of the industry on the islands.
A quarter of farmers were left living below the poverty line.
In order to reverse the industry's decline, Ifad commissioned French organic chocolate producer Kaoka to assess the country's cocoa sector.
Kaoka found that if the farmers could produce cocoa certified as organic, they could improve the price of their crop.
Now - in a scheme backed by Ifad and Cafedirect - the farmers' fortunes have been transformed.
By coming together in co-operatives and by processing their cocoa, they have managed to get a much better return on their crop.
""Before Cafedirect I would work from day-to-day, hand-to-mouth,"" says Mr Esperansa.
""I did not think about the future.""
Cafedirect head Anne MacCaig recently travelled to the islands to see how it was done.
""They have the facilities to ferment the product and then from that they are able to work together across the different organisations to dry the cocoa, collect it all in one central warehouse,"" she said.
""Then they are able to export it.
""They are benefiting from five times the price they had when they sold it as a gloopy white liquid.""
Before the programme began in 2004, Sao Tome produced just 50 tonnes of cocoa.
By mid-2010 this had risen to 600 tonnes of organic, Fairtrade beans.
Many producers have invested in home improvements and can now afford items like bicycles, generators, radios and refrigerators.
The co-operatives are investing in primary health-care clinics and better sanitation.
But is the support for the cocoa crop tying the farmers into a single crop, monoculture?
Mrs MacCaig says it will not.
""Sao Tome is an island with incredibly rich volcanic soil, so if you can do this with cocoa, there are so many other products that can be grown as well.""","Farmers on the islands of Sao Tome and Principe, off the coast of West Africa, are again enjoying the sweet taste of success thanks to high-quality, organic, Fairtrade cocoa - the raw ingredient for chocolate."

549,"But the chairman, European Council President Donald Tusk, will keep the two discussions separate - despite concern that some jihadists are slipping into the EU posing as migrants and exploiting the freedom of movement provided by the Schengen zone.
At least two of the killers involved in the Paris attacks got in among the crowds of migrants arriving daily on the Greek islands near Turkey.
But EU leaders are anxious to avoid sounding like the nationalists who argue that the removal of border controls in the EU left Europeans more at risk from terrorists. That is the rallying cry of the French National Front (FN) and some other populist parties.
Migration and terrorism are also treated as separate issues because - as pointed out by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - many asylum-seekers are themselves fleeing from the terror inflicted by Islamic State (IS), the Taliban and other extremist groups.
The dilemma for the EU is that Schengen - the passport-free area embracing 26 countries - greatly eases the flow of people and goods across the EU, but also requires more information-sharing, to prevent cross-border criminality.
About 1.7 million EU citizens cross borders daily in the Schengen zone to go to work, the Bruegel think-tank reports.
And opinion polls indicate that many Europeans value Schengen more than any other change brought about by the EU.
But temporary border controls have been reimposed - by France, Germany, Austria and Hungary.
So the stakes are high at this summit.
""Our goal is clear: we must regain control over our external borders to stem migratory flows and to preserve Schengen,"" said Mr Tusk in his summit invitation letter.
Mr Juncker said Europeans now have ""one border"" and ""a shared responsibility to protect it"".
""We want to defend everything Schengen represents, and let me tell you that Schengen is here to stay,"" he told the European Parliament.
Saving Schengen means beefing up the surveillance of all people entering or leaving the Schengen area.
So in future EU citizens, as well as those from outside the bloc, will have their passports checked against police databases.
There is much work to do, however, to link up and improve those databases.
More than a million refugees and other migrants have surged into the EU this year, most of them desperate to reach Germany or other northern countries where job prospects are better, or where relatives can help them settle.
The Syrian war has pushed irregular migration to the EU to a record high.
There are fears that the international campaign to smash IS, and the Russian bombing in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, will drive even more Syrians to flee abroad.
So the 28 leaders in Brussels will look again at the EU's help for Greece and Turkey. The migrant registration process is still slow and patchy.
Turkey, struggling with more than two million Syrian refugees, now has much bargaining power. Critics say the EU risks compromising its human rights standards as it leans on Turkey to curb the migrant flow.
Greek coastguards and the EU's Frontex border agency only manage to intercept 20% of the migrants who reach Greek islands after life-threatening voyages, according to Frontex.
This week the Commission unveiled an ambitious plan for a new EU Border and Coast Guard to tackle problems on the EU's external borders.
The force - stronger than Frontex - would have 1,000 permanent staff and 1,500 reserves, who could be deployed rapidly to a trouble spot, within three days.
That could happen even without the host country requesting it - if the rest of the EU decides to take action.
Such force majeure might be the exception - but Poland has already raised objections on sovereignty grounds.

Unwired Planet had sought $33m (Â£25.7m) and a cut of iPhone and iPad sales, which it said made use of its tech.
The terms of the settlement have not been made public.
Apple had previously described the case - involving voice recognition and data transmission inventions - as being ""frivolous"".
Nevada-based Unwired used to develop mobile software, when it was known as Openwave Systems, but no longer makes products of its own.
It acquired the rights to the inventions involved in the case from Ericsson in a controversial deal. Rather than purchase the technologies outright, Unwired instead agreed to share future revenues generated from the patents with the Swedish telecoms equipment-maker.
That has led some to describe Unwired as a ""patent troll"" - although the firm's legal team described the term as ""hackneyed"".
""Our ambition is to bring efficiency and fairness to patent licensing and create a marketplace where product manufacturers and innovators feel confident that high quality technology is available at a fair and reasonable price,"" a spokeswoman for PanOptis Patent Management, which recently bought Unwired's licensing business, told the BBC.

553,"The value of the invested savings and pensions of millions of people in the UK are dependant on asset managers.
In a damning report, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said there is weak price competition, leaving customers paying high charges.
An industry association said price transparency had been improving.
The FCA has studied the asset management system for a year, and has now published its interim report.
In a string of criticisms, it said that investors often paid high charges, there were examples of poor value for money in some funds, and that consultants could bring better results for pension savers.
""In today's world of persistently low interest rates, it is vital that we do everything possible to enable people to accumulate and earn a return on their savings which can meet their lifetime needs,"" said Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA.
""To achieve this, we need to ensure that competition in asset management works effectively to minimise the cost of investment.
""We want to see greater transparency so that investors can be clear about what they are paying and the impact charges have on their returns. We want asset managers to ensure investors receive value for money through pursuing energetically their duty to act in their customers' best interests.""
He ruled out a price cap, which he argued would not encourage competition.
Some investors have been critical of the sector for years, owing to the complicated structure of fees that can include charges for performance and transactions.
There was criticism in the report of ""actively-managed funds"" when a fund manager is paid to research the market. The extra cost to investors of this service were, on average, ""not justified by higher returns"", it said.
The FCA is proposing an all-in fee among other measures to help investors decide which fund is the best for them.
It also wants a more standard set of information across the sector making costs and charges clear.
The potential benefits of UK pension funds pooling their assets to gain better returns should also be explored, the FCA said.
The Investment Association, the trade body that represents UK investment managers, said that it had already been improving the transparency of costs.
""The investment management industry is committed to serving the needs of the UK's savers and investors and so we support the FCA's objectives to ensure that competition in the industry works to the benefit of its customers, whether individuals, families or institutions,"" said Chris Cummings, the association's chief executive.
""Over the coming weeks, we will engage closely with the FCA to understand its findings and the full implications of potential remedies.""
The interim report now goes to consultation. The FCA said action could be announced next summer.
One of the City's most lucrative gravy trains is running out of steam.
Fund managers occupy a cosy world in which they have plenty of wiggle room on charges, make high profits and pick up tasty bonuses.
The FCA's solution is to have one easily-comparable charge and make value for money a priority. It might even ask the government to impose a statutory duty of care.
But the question which really stands out from this investigation is whether active fund management is really worth it. That's when managers pick the stocks they think will succeed.
The FCA found that investors in a passive fund which just tracks the market could earn a 44% higher return over 20 years, because of lower charges.
Most investors would forgive even a sizeable charge if they had something to show for it.","Investors should be quoted a single ""all-in fee"" so the amount taken in charges from their investment returns is clear, a regulator has said."

But what do we know about how well Wales is doing? How many students are going to university? And what happens next for those still with big decisions to make?
MAKING THE GRADE
A new top grade, A*, was introduced in 2010. A total of 6.6% achieved this in 2016, a fall on last year and still short of the UK average of 8.1%.
The proportion of students getting A* and A also fell again from 23.1% to 22.7% and Wales continues to trail the rest of the UK and all regions of England apart from the North East of England.
When you look at individual subjects, more students in Wales have been getting top grades in maths over the last five years than in England - but in English language, Wales has been trailing, with the gap still 3.2% in the latest set of results.
In French, 31% got A* to A in Wales - this is an improvement, but 37.8% managed that in England. The gap was as wide as 14% in 2012. Numbers of students taking French have also gone down by 11% this year.
Wales and England are a little further apart now at the top grades for A-level physics, with Wales dropping back to 25.8% behind England on 29.6%.
It is worth looking too at how many students are only getting the lower grades.
A slightly higher proportion in Wales - 23.5% - got D and E grades, compared to 20.6% in England. That gap has also widened slightly too.
Wales has more students getting these lower grades in English (23.2%) than who managed A* to A (15.9%) in the same subject.
There is also a more students getting D and E grades in French in Wales than in England for most of the last six years.
David Evans, secretary of NUT Wales, said A-levels were the first time students specialised in subjects and it was important the quality of education and teaching was there.
""We need to look at the numbers who get  A* and celebrate them, and those who get As, Bs and Cs too,"" he said.
""We need to make sure we have a clear focus on those who achieve the grades they need for university and makes sure support is there for those who go on to do other things as well.""
On the question of whether A-levels are getting easier, Phil McTague, head teacher of Ysgol Eirias in Colwyn Bay said: ""If Usain Bolt sets a new record in the hundred metres, people don't say the hundred metres is getting easier!  Our students have worked really hard this year and we're proud of all their results.""
HOW DOES WALES COMPARE WITH ENGLISH REGIONS?
For the first time last year, we were able to compare Wales' results with regions of England on the day they were published.
Wales has the lowest percentage of A*-C grades of any area - 73.8- including every English region.
It also has the lowest for A* and A - apart from the North East of England, which is now lower than Wales.
WHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS?
Girls continue to outperform boys overall in Wales, with 97.9% of entries by girls this year gaining A* to E grades, compared to 96.5% of boys.
At the A* grade, the performance of boys was marginally better than that of girls, with 6.7% of boys and 6.5% of girls gaining A* - both improving since 2013.
You can also see performance differences between boys and girls for the top grades within subjects - as well as a difference in subjects chosen. The likes of physics and computing are very male dominated compared to French, English and Welsh at the other end of the scale.
Gareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC exam board, said some of the patterns were long standing ""and a natural feature"".
Why do more girls go to university?
HOW MANY STUDENTS APPLY FROM WALES?
There were 23,740 students from Wales applying to universities in the UK this year - and with many looking at more than one university, this meant a total of 40,010 applications to Ucas.
There is very little difference in the number of students from Wales applying to university over the last few years.
More than half a million students got higher education places in the UK last year - three quarters of those who applied. These included 20,500 students from Wales, a 1.7% rise and a new high, while 87.5% of 18-year-olds from Wales who applied got places.
Of those 18-year-old students who applied to Welsh universities, 84% got an offer, while 75% of Welsh applicants to English universities got an offer.
Although there is a lot of attention at schools on results day - only around half of those entering university are 18-year-olds; others take gap years while the number of students over 26 is rising again.
By the end of Thursday, Ucas said 17,510 students from Wales had places in higher education - more than at the same time over the last five years.
STILL, MORE 18-YEAR-OLDS ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY
Wales recorded its highest entry rate - 28.2% of all 18-year-olds got higher education places through Ucas in 2015 - although that is behind England on 31.3%.
Wales has had one of the lowest proportional increases of UK nations and regions since 2006 - 13%.
WHERE YOU LIVE CAN BE A FACTOR
Fewer pupils from poorer parts of Wales get to university.
Entry rates are broken down across the UK into constituencies and analysis shows they are lower in more disadvantaged areas.
In Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North.
For those in the most disadvantaged districts in Wales the average rate is 16.6%, almost the same as the year before.
But compared with entry rates five years ago, 18-year-olds from disadvantaged areas in Wales were 23% more likely to be accepted for entry in 2015 - in England they were 30% more likely.
Meanwhile, students living in what are classed as the most advantaged areas of Wales are five-and-a-half times more likely to go to a university with higher entry requirements than those from the most disadvantaged parts.
Leading academic Prof Sir Deian Hopkin said the numbers from poorer backgrounds getting to university were still disappointing despite efforts.
""One of the great challenges in higher education is to attract students from less-affluent backgrounds because. very often, they come from an education system which doesn't encourage them to come to university in the first place,"" he said.
""Now a lot has been done over the years, there has been a big improvement, but the proportion has not grown at the same rate as the total increase in students in higher education. Therefore the challenge remains.""
Prof Hopkin added: ""The disappointment in England is that the grant which supported many students has been abolished.
""In Wales, at least that has been maintained for now, but we need to see far more effort being put into encouraging, supporting and, indeed, mentoring students from backgrounds where these things are not natural.""
WHERE DO STUDENTS AT WELSH UNIVERSITIES COME FROM?
Altogether, 77,750 students have already applied to Welsh universities - 18,450 from within Wales.
The chart shows where the others come from - more than half of them from England.
UNCONDITIONAL OFFERS ON THE RISE
There has been a rise in students receiving unconditional offers from universities - which will have relieved the exam pressure a little for some. Across the UK, offers were made to 23,400 students in 2015,  compared to only 3,000 two years before.
This is around 2.5% of applications and involves 36 institutions, but there is no breakdown of how many are from Wales.
Cardiff and Swansea universities only made unconditional offers to students who are pre-qualified. This amounted to 1,200 for Cardiff this year.
Aberystwyth University said it made offers based on performance in its own scholarship exam, while Bangor University said it made unconditional offers to some of the most promising students, but they were looking ""at the whole package"" before deciding where to go.
CLEARING: NO LONGER A LAST RESORT
Around 4,100 students from Wales were looking for places on results day through the clearing system, which is a lower number than the last five years.
A total of 300 students from Wales were given places on the first day, according to Ucas.
Clearing has become more of an accepted way in, no longer something to be embarrassed about for not getting the right grades.
Ucas says clearing has ""transformed into a respected and important route"" into higher education.
All Welsh universities are promoting their clearing services heavily, promoting many courses across the board.
Cardiff University had around 400 places available through clearing.
Bangor University said it was ""no longer seen or used as an opportunity of last resort"" and said it was seeing more students waiting to get their results before applying.
David Moyle, Aberystwyth University's schools and colleges liaison manager, said there was no longer a stigma attached to clearing.
The university took 1,000 calls last year and was offering ""a limited number of places"" across 315 courses, with demand expected to be high in science and computing.
The aim is to ensure students ""get the best advice to make an informed decision"", said Mr Moyle.
Back in 2013, Ben Grantham's A-level results were better than he expected and he was on the phone within an hour to clearing to get a place studying media and communication.
""With a process such as clearing it's important to act fast,"" said Ben, who recently graduated with first class honours.
""Hundreds of students will be in a position where they wish to apply for a course immediately following their results, and places are often limited and can fill up fast.""
Joanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said clearing could sometimes be a blessing in disguise to give students a chance to reflect and warned against making rushed decisions.
""Take a breath, do your research, look at the Ucas website for what's available or even ring the university you wanted to go to to see if they might still accept you first.,"" she said.
""There is often more than one university in towns and cities - don't make a rash decision, it's important, with the amount of money it will cost you, that you make the choice of course that's right for you.""

WHAT IF I DON'T GET THE RIGHT GRADES?
Kerry Ann Wallace, 20, from Newbridge, Caerphilly, was upset after failing to get the right grades to study psychology last year but was in touch with a careers adviser.
It led her to a youth work apprenticeship at Torfaen council and she has ambitions to be a family support worker.
""I haven't looked back and it's great to be earning money while I learn,"" she said.
""If you're disappointed this week please go and talk to someone as I did, look online for things and don't be upset - find something you love.""
Career adviser Joanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said it was important to take stock and look at options - but volunteering, an internship or part-time work can be useful additions to CVs ahead of the next step.
Some will retake exams but there are also useful websites, such as notgoingtouni, which can point students on the career path, including apprenticeships.
""There's a choice,"" said Ms Harris. ""Just because you didn't get into Cardiff University, say, there might be a course somewhere else, there are foundation degrees and feeder degrees.
""If you're struggling, book an appointment with us or call us.""","Thousands of students in Wales have received their A-level results, while universities will over the next few weeks deal with hundreds of remaining places through clearing."

The only plots left are for people with an exclusive right of burial.

561,"Cesc Fabregas marked his 300th Premier League appearance by firing the Blues ahead, poking the ball through the legs of Jack Cork and into the net.
The hosts were stunned when Swansea equalised from their first serious attempt on target on the stroke of half-time - Fernando Llorente heading in Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick.
Fabregas hit the bar before Pedro's curling effort restored the lead and Diego Costa netted the third from close range.
Swansea were denied a penalty when Cesar Azpilicueta handled inside the area at 1-1.
This was far from straightforward for Antonio Conte's side and had referee Neil Swarbrick awarded Swansea a penalty shortly before Pedro made it 2-1 then the outcome might have been different.
However, in the end Chelsea's sweeping forward play earned them a 10th straight home Premier League win as they took another significant step towards a second title in three seasons.
On a weekend when the first major silverware of the season - the EFL Cup - is handed out at Wembley, the Blues look unstoppable. They have 63 points from 26 games - three more than at the same stage in 2014-15 when last crowned champions of England.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Fabregas could have ended the game with four goals on his return to the side.
The Spain midfielder had a goal-bound shot deflected behind shortly before he opened the scoring, was denied by former Arsenal team-mate Lukasz Fabianski and also rattled the bar.
With former Blues midfielder Frank Lampard watching on, Chelsea turned on the style.
While it required an error from Fabianski to restore the lead, Eden Hazard's exquisite timing and pass for Costa to make it 3-1 was a delight.
Chelsea were forced to work hard for three points thanks to a well organised and energetic Swansea side and the Swans looked a shadow of the team that was bottom of the Premier League table five weeks ago.
Their four-point safety cushion at the start of the day is down to three, but boss Paul Clement will have been pleased with the way his side frustrated the runaway leaders for long spells.

Llorente's equaliser shook Chelsea who were showing signs of frustration before Pedro made it 2-1.
Swansea's next four games - Burnley (home), Hull City (away), Bournemouth (away) and Middlesbrough (home) - give them a chance to stay clear of the bottom three before they entertain Tottenham on 4 April.
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte: ""We played very well, it was a good performance, and we created many chances to score. We conceded at the end of the first half, after the time was finished, so in this case there was a bit of luck, but we showed great character in the second half.
""We deserved a lot to win the game, now it's important to continue in this way.""
Swansea City boss Paul Clement: ""Any game we play and don't win we are disappointed. Chelsea are a very good side, they have fantastic quality and that was the difference. We didn't have a lot of chances but we came in at 1-1 for half-time and for long periods we defended really well.
""There was a big moment with the handball, I thought Cesar Azpilicueta handled it at 1-1, it's a clear handball. That gives you a chance to go 2-1 up but three minutes later you're 2-1 down with a soft goal. Based on chances they deserved to win, but there was  big moment that didn't go our way, and who knows what might have happened.""
Former England midfielder Jermaine Jenas: ""I don't think Swansea should have had a penalty as the distance from Gylfi Sigurdsson to Cesar Azpilicueta is too close and Azpilicueta's arm is already out. His hand is there because he's trying to stop Sigurdsson's run.""
Ex-England captain Alan Shearer: ""I think it was a penalty. I think it was a deliberate movement of his hand towards the ball and I think Chelsea got away with one there. It could have been very different if the ref had given it.
""We've seen in recent weeks with Swansea that they made it very difficult for Liverpool at Anfield, they were unlucky to lose at Manchester City. They are very organised. The difference between Liverpool and City with this Chelsea side is the pace with which they go forward. That's why Cesc Fabregas was in the team today. He was brilliant. He's the one that started the goal off.
""It's topical that players are not working for mangers. The irony is last season we were sat here with a large bunch of these same Chelsea players - they weren't working for their manager and we know what happened. It's such a transformation now. We saw how brilliant they were with the ball but look at them now without it. The transformation from then to now is incredible.""

564,"Jamal al-Harith reportedly received £1m from the British government after being freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2004.
Lord Carlile said the payment was wrong as al-Harith was ""plainly a terrorist"".
Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended his government's decision to free him from Guantanamo.
Al-Harith, who was 50 and from Manchester, was originally known as Ronald Fiddler.
He took the name Jamal al-Harith when he converted to Islam, but was known most recently by the nom-de-guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani, given to him by so-called Islamic State.
Who are Britain’s jihadists?
Al-Harith was seized by American forces in Pakistan in 2001, before being sent to Guantanamo Bay - a US prison in Cuba for terrorist suspects.
US interrogators found he provided useful information about the Taliban's methods, and he was released after two years.
He later joined IS and blew himself up at an Iraqi army base in Mosul this week.
Lord Carlile - who reviewed terror laws from 2001 to 2011 - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It [the compensation] should never have been paid.
""There was absolutely no merit in paying him a penny, because plainly he was a terrorist.""
He said he believed the settlement was paid to avoid disclosure in court of security service activities.
A Downing Street spokesman declined to answer questions about the reported payout, on the grounds it was an intelligence matter.
But Mr Blair released a statement accusing the Daily Mail of ""utter hypocrisy"" after it ran a story about al-Harith on Wednesday headlined: ""Still Think He Wasn't A Danger, Mr Blair? Fury at Labour government's £1m compensation for innocent Brit"".
He said the man's release in 2004 had ""followed a Parliamentary and massive media campaign led by the Daily Mail... and strongly supported by the then Conservative Opposition"".
The former PM continued: ""He was not paid compensation by my government. The compensation was agreed in 2010 by the [coalition] government...""
Lord Blunkett, who was home secretary at the time of al-Harith's release, said he had never campaigned for his return, but ""fully accepted that the situation of British citizens held without trial there, was unsustainable and legally and morally indefensible"".
The government in 2004 had ""acted responsibly"" he said, adding that ""public controversy"" at the time had been about whether enough was being done to release detainees ""and not the wisdom of providing balanced reassurance"".
Lord Blunkett said those returning from Guantanamo Bay were kept under surveillance and monitored by the security services.
Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary in 2004, said he ""never regarded"" al-Harith as innocent ""and neither Mr Blair nor I ever said that he was innocent"".
""We judged that the risk was not so great as to prevent his release.
""Whenever you're making decisions about the release of prisoners you have to make a judgement, and sometimes those judgements are not borne out by events.""
Leon Jameson, al-Harith's older brother, says they last spoke two years ago on the phone, before he went to Syria.
Mr Jameson described his sibling as ""fun"" when he was growing up and ""always helping other people"".
When asked about his brother's suicide bombing he said: ""I can't actually commend him about it because it isn't right, but he's done it. It's something he believes in, so I'll leave that with him.
""He did what he could for other people, which is what he used to always be like.
And he said ""it had been a struggle"" for his brother ever since Guantanamo Bay. ""If he didn't even listen to his wife, none of us could have really changed his mind.""","A British IS fighter who carried out a suicide attack in Iraq should never have received a penny in compensation, a former independent reviewer of UK terrorism legislation has said."
565,"A black police chief who had worked diligently to improve community relations, and reduce the use of force, now had to confront a racially motivated attack by a young black man against his officers.
""We're hurting. Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken,"" he said.
He spoke on behalf of the Dallas Police Department, but his words echoed a personal statement he made six years earlier, in the wake of another Dallas police death.
In June 2010, just weeks after he was sworn in as police chief, a young Dallas officer and father was shot dead on father's day. The killer was Mr Brown's 27-year-old son.
""My family has not only lost a son, but a fellow police officer and a private citizen lost their lives at the hands of our son,"" he said.
""That hurts so deeply I cannot adequately express the sadness I feel inside my heart.""
Mr Brown's son, David O'Neal Brown Jr, first shot dead a private citizen, Jeremy McMillan, as McMillan drove his family to his sister's house. He then shot police officer Craig Shaw, who was responding to the first shooting, more than a dozen times.
Mr Brown took a leave of absence, according to local news reports from the time, and there was speculation that he would resign.
It was not the first time he had suffered loss - in 1988, his former partner Walter Williams was killed in the line of duty. Three years later, his younger brother was shot dead by a drug dealer.
But Mr Brown returned to work, determined to improve the Dallas Police Department's relations with the community. The department began to focus on de-escalation rather than force. Mr Brown placed emphasis on community policing and increasing transparency, even at the cost of clashing with department figures.
He made enemies of the police unions by publicly sacking crooked officers, the Dallas Observer reported. He was told community policing was a waste of time.
But by 2014, five years after his appointment, excessive force complaints against Dallas officers had fallen by 64%.
""In my opinion, how can you argue with aggressive community policing if it has yielded the safest the city has been over 86 years?"" he said in an interview with the Observer in February.
Mr Brown's approach was visible on Thursday, in the hours before the gunman opened fire, as the police department's Twitter account posted pictures of officers posing with protesters and smiling.
""Men, women, boys and girls gathered at Belo Garden Park for the demonstration re: recent police involved shootings,"" said one tweet.
""Dallas police officers maintain traffic control to ensure the safety of the demonstrators,"" said another.
In the aftermath of the attack, several reporters who cover the Dallas Police Department pointed out the irony that the gunman targeted a force which had made strides to break the cycle of violence between its officers and community.
Speaking to the Observer in February, Mr Brown paid tribute to his officers and acknowledged the risks they took.
""Over the last 12 years we've lost five cops in the line of duty,"" he said. ""I mean, it's not just numbers on a page. It's sacrifice, and it's sacrifice at the highest level.""
Dallas Police Department equalled that 12-year sacrifice in a few short hours on Thursday. On Friday, Mr Brown reiterated his plea for mutual respect.
""There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city,"" he said. ""All I know is that this: This must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens.""","When five Dallas police officers were shot dead by a sniper on Thursday, it fell to David Brown, the city's police chief, to sum up the shock and grief of the force and the community."
566,"Mr Trump also said Republicans were coming at him ""from all sides"" and their disloyalty was harder to fight than the Democrats.
Mr Ryan is the latest Republican not to back Mr Trump after a 2005 video emerged showing him making obscene comments about groping women.
However Mr Trump has been strongly supported by running mate Mike Pence.
""You have nominated a man for president who never quits, who never backs down. He is a fighter, he is a winner,"" Mr Pence said at an event in Iowa, praising him for apologising during Sunday's debate for his lewd comments.
The renewed party divisions over Mr Trump come as a new PRRI/Atlantic poll suggested Mrs Clinton holds a 49-38 lead over her opponent.
A video released on Friday revealed Mr Trump describing how he had sought to have sex with a married woman and making other sexually aggressive comments about women.
On Tuesday, President Barack Obama's spokesman said Mr Trump's remarks were ""repugnant"" and amounted to sexual assault.
Nearly half the 331 incumbent Republican senators, House members and governors have condemned Trump's lewd remarks on the video and about 10% have called for him to drop out of the race, Reuters news agency reports.
On Monday, Mr Ryan told fellow House Republicans he would focus on congressional elections to ensure Republicans could maintain legislative control.
Mr Trump fired back in a string of tweets, saying the ""shackles"" had been removed, allowing him to ""fight for America the way I want to"".
He also attacked Senator John McCain, who has denounced Trump's conduct and faces a close re-election battle, as ""foul-mouthed""
Though the latest revelation underscores a widening divide within the Republican Party, some members insist they are sticking by Mr Trump.
Donald Trump isn't going gently into that good night.
If the Republican Party, led by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, follows through with its promise to abandon his campaign in hopes of preserving its congressional majority, he appears willing to burn it to the ground and salt the earth.
That was the takeaway from the Republican standard-bearer's unprecedented Tuesday morning Twitter storm. Reportedly delivered from the confines of his eponymous tower in New York, Mr Trump lashed out at a party establishment that never really wanted him as its nominee and only grudgingly backed him in the hopes that he was a force they could control.
That was a misguided belief.
Mr Trump sees himself as bigger than the party whose primary voters he courted, and now he will open fire on perceived enemies who surround him. Democrat Hillary Clinton, in a new television advert, lacks the ""stamina"" to lead. Mr Ryan, he tweeted, is ""weak and ineffective"".
Mr Trump, in his own words, is ""unshackled"" at last. In 2008 Republicans fretted that their vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, had ""gone rogue"" and was woefully off-message. Eight years later, an entire presidential campaign has become unmoored and is threatening to rage against the fabric of their party.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said he was ""really disturbed"" by Mr Trump's comments about women but still planned to support him, saying the election was ""about bigger issues than that"".
Texas Senator and former rival Ted Cruz also said he would still cast his ballot for Mr Trump, telling a Texas TV station that Mrs Clinton was an ""absolute disaster"".
Another rival from the primaries, Senator Marco Rubio, said he would also back Mr Trump.
Meanwhile, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus held an emergency call with members on Monday to declare the party would stand behind Mr Trump despite recent turmoil, US media reported.

568,"About 150 people had gathered near the interior ministry, demanding the release of political prisoners.
It follows Tuesday's ""day of rage"" when hundreds calling for democracy protested in Damascus and Aleppo.
The interior ministry said ""infiltrators"" tried to stir chaos. But among those held was a 10-year-old boy.
Activists say he was with his father - and both were detained.
Others included 69-year-old Damascus university philosophy professor and author Tayeb Tizini, and leading human rights activist Suhair Atassi.
""They pulled Suhair by her hair and took her away,"" one demonstrator said, according to Reuters.
Journalist and activist Mazen Darwish told the BBC that he was set free only after being held for five hours in the military security branch's detention centre alongside 20 others, including women. A further 15 were still being detained by state security, he said.
""When I showed them my international press card they shouted and said 'Why were you standing among protesters and not among the journalists?',"" said Mr Darwish, head of the Syrian Centre for Freedom of Speech.
No further information about those detained was immediately available.
No dissent
The ruling Baath party has dominated Syrian politics for nearly 50 years.
President Bashar al-Assad - who came to power in 2000 after three decades of rule by his father Hafez - has moved slowly to open up the economy, but his administration does not tolerate any dissent.
Some of the 150 protesters who gathered held photos of those they said had been imprisoned for their political views.
""After a long wait and rumours of an impending release of prisoners of conscience in Syria, our hopes have vanished,"" said a statement from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The organisation - which groups together the families of 21 jailed human rights activists - had said it planned to demonstrate in front of the ministry on Wednesday.
Reports said that shortly after the protesters gathered a counter-demonstration was held in the same square with people chanting that they would defend the Syrian president ""with our soul, with our blood"".
The interior ministry denied that the initial protest was political in nature.
""There were some persons who took advantage of this call to slip among these people and tried to shout some slogans,"" said Gen Mohamed Hassan al-Ali, of the interior ministry's moral guidance department.
There are thousands of political prisoners in Syrian jails, and major opposition groups are banned.
The government also blocks access to several internet sites and maintains strict control of the media though authorities have lifted bans on Facebook and YouTube in the wake of uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.
In January, President Assad told the Wall Street Journal that Syria was more stable than Tunisia and Egypt. He said that there was no chance of political upheaval, and pledged to press on with a package of reforms.
The BBC's Lina Sinjab, in Damascus, said that many had doubted that any protests would take place in Syria, but observers here believe events over the past couple of days have broken the silence that dominated the country.","At least 35 people have been arrested after they defied a ban on demonstrations and protested in the Syrian capital, reports say."
569,"MOTD2 pundit Danny Murphy expands on his TV analysis of the part his former Tottenham team-mate Jermain Defoe played in Sunderland's vital derby win over Newcastle.
When I realised his starting position was on the right wing in a 4-3-3 formation, I was surprised to say the least.
I know Jermain well from training and playing with and against him, and he does not particularly like playing in those wide areas - he certainly did not enjoy it back in the day.
That is understandable because he is a goalscorer and he lives off the goals he gets. He does not normally like being in areas of the pitch where he cannot affect the game in a positive way.
But obviously he was asked to play a different role by Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat because of their circumstances and he did a brilliant job for the team.
I have never seen Defoe work as hard as he did to contribute defensively on Sunday - he tracked back on the left too and at one point he was making sliding tackles near his own corner flag, which was a first.
He is 32 now and he will not want to be doing that permanently. But knowing him like I do, if he is asked to do any kind of job for his team to help them stay in the Premier League then he will always give it his all.
I do not think playing him there gets the best out of him, but it worked for Sunderland on Sunday.
Ultimately, Defoe only had one shot at goal in his 80 minutes on the pitch, but it was a world-class finish to win Sunderland the game and three vital points.
That is what they signed him for, and you could see from his celebration how much it meant to him.
I have played in midfield behind Defoe and he is a very special talent in that he does not solely rely on through-balls.
If you get the ball to his feet, he has got the capability around the box to beat people himself and shoot from range with real power.
Defoe has pace and thrives on being put through too of course, but one of the reasons he has scored as many goals as he has done in his career is that there are so many different elements to his game.
Yes he will get in the six-yard box to score you a tap-in but he can create goals for himself and, as Newcastle found out, score from distance as well.
Before that goal, he had not scored for six games which will have been hurting him because he is not used to it.
But I know that it will not have knocked his confidence because he is the sort of player that never loses faith in himself, and for good reason.
That bit of class he produced against Newcastle was the kind of moment of brilliance I have come to expect from him after playing with and against him down the years.
Defoe's appetite was typical of the rest of the Sunderland team.
What Dick Advocaat's side lack in quality, they make up for in physicality and endeavour which is a massive positive for them.
They have got some powerful players and they look fit, which is an often overlooked factor at this stage of the season.
Against Newcastle, both of their full-backs - Billy Jones and Patrick van Aanholt - did brilliantly, flying up the wings.
They also have a few clever players, like Jordi Gomez and Seb Larsson, who have been in this position at the bottom of the table before and will be used to the pressure involved when you are fighting relegation.
From what I saw of them in this game, they have got enough about them to beat the drop.
But that is mainly because of the quality Defoe gives them in the final third. He could be the difference between them staying up, or not.
Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",Jermain Defoe's brilliant winner against Newcastle has made the headlines but it was the less spectacular parts of his performance that stood out for me.
570,"Poorer pupils are particularly badly affected, says the head teacher training charity Future Leaders Trust.
Researchers plotted the distance between state schools in England against the proportion of pupils achieving five good GCSEs.
The steepness of the drop in poorer pupils' grades was ""quite astounding"", said report author Katy Theobald.
Looking at average GCSE attainment over three years to 2014, all students did worse in schools that were further apart - but the impact was greater on students eligible for free school meals, the researchers found.
Schools less than 1km (0.6 miles) apart saw almost 68% of pupils overall achieving five A* to C GCSE grades. Among pupils eligible for free school meals, the figure was 49%.
But even a slight increase in the distance between schools saw a sharp drop in grades for poorer pupils, according to the study.
A 1-2km gap between schools saw less than 42% of poorer pupils achieving good results, falling to less than 37% for poorer pupils at schools with a 3-4km gap.
Nationally, some 65% of pupils overall achieved five good GCSEs over the three-year period, while the figure for pupils eligible for free school meals was 42.6%.
So pupils at schools less than 1km from their nearest neighbour perform better than average on both counts, say the researchers.
They calculate that for each additional kilometre between schools, the attainment of free school meals students declines by an average of 1.06 percentage points.
However, the average attainment of free school meals students was not lowest in the most geographically isolated schools - more than 15km from their nearest neighbours, according to the researchers, although it was still poorer than in the most highly populated areas.
Some of the success of urban schools stemmed from the fact it was so much easier for teachers collaborate, said Ms Theobald.
""If you are in London you can just pop into another school to observe good practice - if you are in an isolated school, it's a whole day away,"" she said.
It is also harder for isolated schools to recruit staff at all levels, according to Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.
And all too often they were in areas of high unemployment, ""which makes the job of raising pupils' aspirations that little bit more difficult"", said Mr Trobe.","Pupils at isolated schools do worse at GCSE than teenagers in areas with a choice of schools, suggests research."
571,"Brierley, who signed from Championship side Leigh Centurions in March, had never crossed in the top flight before.
Wigan tries from Anthony Gelling, John Bateman and Matty Smith made it 18-18.
Smith and Danny Brough swapped drop-goals before Smith landed a second one-pointer and Dan Sarginson's score sent the Warriors to the summit.
Shaun Wane's Wigan moved two points clear of Warrington and Catalans, although for so long it appeared that the visitors would register two successive wins for the first time in 2016 and move off the foot of the table.
Brierley's hat-trick was high in quality - Leroy Cudjoe's break set up his first, while his second was created by Brough's superb grubber kick.
After Huddersfield had been pegged back to 12-12 by Bateman's close-range score, some free-flowing handling gave Brierley a free run to the line - a try scored while team-mate Nathan Mason was in the sin-bin.
The final 10 minutes became a drop-goal contest between half-backs Smith and Brough, and Wigan forged a crucial one-point lead before England international Sarginson raced over in the dying seconds to clinch a thrilling victory.
Defeat for Huddersfield, who have been beaten in 10 of their 12 Super League games this season, was further soured by the loss of centre Jake Connor to a serious-looking ankle injury just before half-time.

572,"Crowds danced, sang and waved rainbow flags at the event held outside the capital Kampala, the culmination of a week of celebrations.
One of those attending hoped it would be a ""step forward"" for the country.
But many people in Uganda strongly oppose gay rights, and homosexuality is punishable with a jail sentence.
Anti-gay legislation allowing for life imprisonment for ""aggravated homosexuality"" and banning the ""promotion of homosexuality"" was annulled by Uganda's supreme court last year.
One of those marching, Moses Kimbugwe, said: ""It is about trying to show the wider community that violence, discrimination, harassment, stigma against LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) people is bad.
""So we are here to send a message to the wider population that we do exist, and we want rights like any other Ugandan.""
One of the organisers, Richard Lusimbo, told the AFP news agency: ""For us, this is a celebration of who we are.""
Events earlier this week included a transgender awareness day and a ""Mr and Miss Pride"" beauty pageant.
US President Barack Obama spoke out in favour of gay rights in Africa on his recent visit to the continent but some African leaders have argued homosexuality is not part of African culture.","Activists in Uganda have held a gay pride rally, a year since a law requiring homosexuals to be jailed for life was overturned."
573,"Spain is implementing drastic spending cuts to try to slash its budget deficit to 5.3% from 8.5% in 2011.
Many economists said the target was always unrealistic.
Last weekend, Spain was given 100bn euros ($125bn; Â£80bn) in emergency loans to help its struggling banks.
The IMF said Spain needed to raise revenue from taxes, and look at further spending cuts. However, it added that Madrid should not look to cut its deficit too quickly given ""an unprecedented double-dip recession with unemployment already high"".
Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone, with almost one in four workers out of a job.
Earlier this year, the government announced 27bn euros of cuts from its budget as part of one of the toughest austerity drives in the country's history.
Changes included freezing unemployment benefits and public sector workers' salaries, slashing departmental budgets and increasing tax on large companies.
But the spending cuts and tax rises have undermined the economic recovery in Spain. The country is back in recession and its banks are severely under-capitalised given the collapse in the Spanish property market.
The 100bn-euro bailout has failed to restore confidence in the country's economy, with the interest rate, or yield, paid on government bonds traded in the secondary market hitting 7% on Thursday, a level widely seen as unsustainable.
Bond yields in the secondary market are seen as a good indication of investor's confidence in a government's ability to repay its debts.","Spain is likely to miss its budget targets for this year and Madrid should adopt wider reforms to reduce its debts, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
574,"The Independent Police Complaints Commission said Operation Midland was ""extensive and carried out diligently"".
There was no evidence to indicate ""bad faith, malice or dishonesty"" by the officers, the watchdog said.
The much-criticised operation closed last March without a single arrest.
Of five officers referred to the Commission, three were cleared of causing ""prolonged and undue stress"" to those being investigated.
One of the three - an unnamed detective chief inspector - is being investigated over an alleged failure to present relevant information to a judge when applying for a search warrant.
Former MP Harvey Proctor, who was among those cleared of being part of an alleged Westminster abuse ring, said the ""bungled and disastrous"" police operation had ruined his life and left him destitute.
He said he believed no police officer would ever be held responsible for it, and accused the IPCC of conducting a ""whitewash"".
The Â£2.5m Met investigation was launched in 2014 after a man known as ""Nick"" claimed that boys had been sexually abused and even murdered by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies.
The abuse was said to have been carried out at locations across southern England and London in the 1970s and 1980s.
Retired judge Sir Richard Henriques reviewed the investigation and identified 43 serious failings in his report, including that ""Nick"" had been believed for too long and that search warrants had been applied for with flawed information.
Former Met Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised to those affected by the inquiry, including Mr Proctor, former military chief Lord Bramall, and the wife of the late Lord Brittan, a former home secretary.
The force referred five officers to the IPCC.
The IPCC has now cleared three of them - Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, Detective Superintendant Kenny McDonald and an unnamed detective chief inspector - of causing prolonged and undue stress to those under suspicion by failing to properly investigate ""Nick's"" claims.
Mr McDonald had, at one stage, publicly described ""Nick's"" allegations as ""credible and true"".
In a statement, the IPCC said: ""There is no evidence to indicate bad faith, malice or dishonesty and no indication any of the officers may have behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings.
""The information available indicates the investigation was extensive and carried out diligently with the majority of the decisions made appropriately recorded.""
But the watchdog said there was an indication that the DCI and two other detectives may have failed to accurately present all relevant information to a district judge when applying for search warrants for three properties.
The searches - in March 2015 - resulted in those under suspicion being named in the media.
The IPCC said it was discontinuing its investigation into allegations of irregularities in the seizure of exhibits during the searches.
There will also be no further investigation of Mr Rodhouse for his conduct in relation to a separate inquiry involving Lord Brittan.
IPCC commissioner Carl Gumsley said: ""The allegation that incomplete information may have been provided to a district judge when applying for search warrants is serious and the IPCC will thoroughly investigate this matter.""","Three senior Scotland Yard officers have been cleared over their handling of allegations at the centre of an investigation into VIP paedophile claims, the police watchdog has said."
575,"Mohanna Abdhou was shot in Malvern Road, Kilburn, on Friday night and died at the scene.
In a statement her family said they were ""heartbroken at the loss"" of their ""loving daughter"".
Ms Abdhou, known as Montana, was approached by ""two males"" on bicycles who fired ""shots at her group"".
A post-mortem examination on Saturday gave the cause of death as a single gunshot wound.
Her family said: ""We are truly saddened, heartbroken and still in complete shock that we have lost a beautiful and caring soul.
""No words can truly express our feelings towards this situation.
""She was a loving daughter, sister and friend. She was loved by everyone and her warmth and kindness will be remembered fondly.""
Det Ch Insp Andy Partridge said police had found nothing in Ms Abdou's background ""which gives any suggestion she would have been a target"".
The two suspects have been described as being of medium build and dressed all in dark clothing.
Police said their faces were covered, which ""would have made them stand out on such a warm evening"".","The family of a woman shot dead by two cyclists have paid tribute to the ""beautiful"" 20-year-old who was ""loved by everyone""."
576,"Peadiatric pathologist Dr Paul French told the High Court at Livingston that the child had also suffered double fractures of his thigh bone and arm.
Nyomi Fee, 29, and Rachel Fee, 32, deny killing Rachel's son Liam in a house near Glenrothes on 22 March 2014.
The couple also deny harming two other children.
The court heard that Liam, who was two-and-a-half and not growing as he should, had more than 30 external injuries including bruising to his private parts and signs of internal bleeding at various sites through his torso.
Dr French, 38, who carried out a post mortem examination on Liam two days after he was pronounced dead, told the jury that he found the sac around Liam's heart - the pericardium - was filled with 70ml of fresh blood.
""It shouldn't be there,"" he said. ""It says there's been injury to the heart or that area that's caused that bleeding and the haemmorhage.
""That's a significant volume of blood. For a child of that age that's about 8% of the blood circulating around his body.
""That would impair the function of the heart - it would stop it being able to beat properly and would cause death.""
He said he found a laceration in the wall of the child's right atrium which would have caused his ""rapid death"".
Similar injuries have been found in the victims of high speed road accidents, he added.
He described Liam's broken bone injuries as ""quite severe"" and said the large amount of bleeding in the muscle around the leg fracture could have contributed to his death.
He stressed that heart injury was the most likely cause of Liam's death but said he could not rule out that it had been caused during CPR.
Dr French said the child had a low body weight for his age, in the bottom 4% of the population according to medical charts.
He also said Liam appeared thin, with the muscles in his arms and legs less than he would expect to see in someone of his age.
He said the causes of failure to thrive were natural disease, possibly disease of the muscles, poor diet or potentially neglect.
The jury was shown post mortem photographs of the toddler's broken thigh bone.
The doctor said it was impossible to know how it was caused, apart from blunt force trauma.
He added: ""This child has sustained two fracturing events to his right femur and left humerus three to five days and less than six hours before death.""
The child would have been unlikely to have been able to put weight on his leg, Dr French said. He would have been crying, distressed and upset.
Liam's mother Rachel Fee and her civil partner Nyomi Fee deny murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by blaming the killing on another child.
They also deny a number of child neglect charges involving Liam and two other boys in their care.
The trial before Lord Burns continues.","Toddler Liam Fee suffered a ruptured heart as a result of severe ""blunt force"" trauma, a murder trial has been told."
577,"A Libyan military spokesman told the BBC that the ship's movements at the port of Derna had aroused suspicion.
The oil company rejected this, saying the ship was delivering fuel to industrial facilities there and the authorities had been kept informed.
Derna has been controlled by Islamist militants for the past two years.
The Libyan military attacked the port several times last year in an attempt to weaken militant groups there.
The military spokesman, Colonel Ahmed Mesmari, said the tanker had been targeted because it had failed to submit to an inspection before entering the port.
He said the vessel was supposed to dock at a power plant in Derna but instead ""took a different route"", entering a ""military zone"".
""We asked the ship to stop, but instead it turned off all its lights and would not respond so we were obliged to strike it.
""We bombed it twice,"" he said.
Libya's National Oil Corporation said the tanker had picked up 13,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil in Brega, a port south of Libya's second city, Benghazi, which it was due to deliver to a power plant and water purification facility in Derna.
It said the vessel was attacked before it could enter the port to unload its cargo.
There were 26 crew members on board the ship, Araevo, including nationals from the Philippines, Greece and Romania.
Two were injured in Sunday's attack, in addition to those killed.
The Liberian-flagged tanker is operated by an Athens-based shipping company, Aegean Shipping Enterprises Company.
The company said there was no leakage of oil and it was assessing the damage.
Col Mesmari told Reuters the vessel had been bringing Islamist fighters to Derna.
""We had warned any ship not to dock at the port without prior permission,"" he was quoted as saying.
The National Oil Corporation did not comment on the allegation but said the bombing of the tanker would have a ""very negative"" impact on oil shipping from Libyan ports.
It said it remained neutral in the conflict in Libya and the incident would hinder its ability to maintain supplies within the local market.
Libya has been in chaos since its long-time leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, was overthrown with Western military help in 2011.
Numerous militias govern their own patches of territory, with successive governments struggling to exercise control.
The competition for power and resources has led to frequent fighting and battles to control facilities, including ports, linked to Libya's oil industry.
The internationally recognised government is based in Tobruk, near the Egyptian border, having been expelled from the capital, Tripoli, by militias in 2014.
A rival militia-backed administration now controls the capital while Benghazi is largely in the hands of Islamist fighters.","Libyan air force jets have bombed a Greek-operated oil tanker chartered by Libya's national oil company, killing two crew members."
578,"""That village over there will be flooded,"" he points. ""Monkeys, birds, Indians - we'll all lose our homes.""
Over the last few months some 13,000 Munduruku have been protesting against government plans to build a series of hydroelectric dams that will flood part of their land on the upper reaches of the Tapajos river.
After a week-long meeting back in April, the caciques (chiefs) from more than 60 villages issued a statement, demanding that the government listen to them before it presses ahead with the five dams planned for the river.
Women have not traditionally been fighters among the Munduruku, but now Maria Leusa Kaba Munduruku, the leader of a new group of female warriors, says that everyone must be involved.
""The government must recognise our rights, not just those of others,"" she stresses.
Despite vociferous opposition from indigenous and environmental groups, construction is already well under way for the gigantic Belo Monte dam on the Xingu river.
Now the new frontier for Brazil's hydropower expansion has moved to the Tapajos River - a huge tributary to the Amazon that lies further to the west.
Opposition here is fierce as the region has some of the richest biodiversity in the world.
Adrian Barnett, a British biologist working in the area, says that - even by the high standards of the Amazon basin - the Tapajos is an area of extreme biological richness.
Of the 1,837 species of bird that occur in Brazil, 613 can be found in the Tapajos, he points out.
The government plans to award the contracts for the first of these dams, Sao Luiz do Tapajos, later this year.
Along with the next dam, Jatoba, it should come on stream by 2020.
As well as flooding 552 sq km (213 sq miles) of land, the dikes will change the river flow, disrupting the lives of indigenous and numerous fishing communities.
The dams will have an installed capacity of 8,471 megawatts and will generate as much electricity as Belo Monte.
To mitigate their environmental impact, the government is copying the oil-rig system used in the North Sea, bringing in workers by boat for two-week work shifts rather than building roads.
The authorities are adamant that they need to tap into the huge hydropower potential of the Amazon if Brazil is to have the energy to fuel its ambitious development programme.
Claudio Salles, director of the Acende Brasil energy think tank, says that of the 19,000 additional megawatts the government plans to have by 2021, 16,000 will be generated in the Amazon.
""This gives you an idea of just how important this energy is for us,"" he says.
But some analysts believe that Brazil needs to rethink its development plans.
Celio Bermann, a lecturer in energy and the environment at the University of Sao Paulo, says Brazil is providing big subsidies for electricity-hungry sectors, such as the smelting of bauxite in the Amazon to make aluminium, without thinking whether this is really in the country's long-term interests.
""We are exporting a tonne of aluminium for $1,450-1,500 (Â£855-884) while importing manufactured aluminium goods at twice the cost.
""It makes no sense. I think it is absolutely undesirable for the country's aluminium output to double over the next 10 years,"" Mr Bermann adds.
Brazil, he points out, is going back to being a producer of primary goods, without adding value.
""And it is precisely the production of primary goods that needs a lot of energy and generates few jobs.""
Preparatory work for the construction of the Teles Pires dam to be built on the Teles Pires river, a tributary of the Tapajos, has already led to the bulldozing of land around the Sete Quedas (Seven Waterfalls) - an area considered sacred by the Munduruku and other indigenous people.
In an open letter, Munduruku leaders complained: ""There are funerary urns there, where our ancient warriors are buried. There is also a portal, only seen by spiritual shaman leaders, who can travel through it to another, unknown world.""
""Why have they destroyed this?"" one cacique asked.
For others, however, progress cannot be halted.
Joao Francisco Vieira, a local councillor in the town of Jacareacanga, told the BBC: ""The Indians don't want to go back 300 years. They want to evolve, as the river flows to the sea. They want mobile phones. They want the internet.""
Maria Leusa Kaba Munduruku agrees that they want modern goods.
""But we want them while conserving our culture. That is possible and we will fight for it.""","""If these dams are built, everything will end,"" says Lamberto Painha, one of the chiefs of the Munduruku tribe in Brazil's Amazon region."
579,"Kajsa Tylen, 38, from Nottingham, is intending to ride about 36,000 miles (58,000km).
Her mother, Tina Tylen, 65, will travel as back-up with a caravan during the challenge across Europe.
Mustafa Sarkar, a sports psychologist, said having her mother alongside could be a key factor in breaking the 77-year-old record.
Ms Tylen, who is originally from Sweden, felt inspired after reading about Billie Fleming who pedalled for 29,603 miles (47,641km) in 1938, to encourage others to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
Tina Tylen retired from her job at Specsavers and has since been planning her role in the journey.
The two have not always been so close.
""I moved out of home when I was 16 and we have both lived a fair distance apart since then,"" said Kajsa Tylen.
""We both worked abroad for a while too and didn't really talk much then either.""
Tina Tylen later moved in with her daughter in Nottingham, which Kajsa said was ""tough"" to begin with.
""Once we got to know one another again, it worked out well. She [now] knows to feed me if I start getting tetchy.""
Dr Sarkar said: ""Having her mum by her side will definitely help.
""A crucial part of motivation is about relatedness, the feeling of support.
""Messages from her mum will have to be positive but she will also have to allow [Kajsa] to persevere herself. Knowing she's by her side will be important.""
The cyclist said she had been boosted by ""incredible"" support for the challenge which begins on New Year's Day at Leisure Lakes Bikes in Breaston.
This has included promises of places to stay, offers of food and bike maintenance, as well as ferry tickets when she reaches Denmark, and messages from people on social media.
""Sense of purpose is important"" - Dr Mustafa Sarkar, Nottingham Trent University
""One of the key aspects will be motivation. Her reason of wanting to motivate other people to exercise and this sense of purpose will be really important.
""Some people do [big challenges] for the wrong reasons. [Her own motivation] will really help drive her.
""The notion of self-talk, what she is going to say to herself throughout the challenge, will be important. There will be critical points especially during difficult moments where self-talk will be key.
""This personal link of wanting to motivate other people to exercise will give her a sense of purpose and might help drive her on especially during difficult moments of the challenge.""",A cyclist is beginning her attempt to break a long-standing long distance cycling challenge over the next year.
580,"Warnings have been issued in more than 40 provinces in Spain, with a red alert for the southern city of Cordoba.
Neighbouring Portugal has also placed four regions on an orange alert, the second highest level possible.
Both countries have warned that the searing heat will substantially increase the risk of forest fires.
Nearly all of Spain faced an ""extreme"" or high risk of forest fires on Monday.
""These are not usual meteorological phenomena,"" said a spokesperson of the country's national weather office, as quoted by the AFP news agency.
They warned that the exceptional temperatures posed ""a very high level of risk for the population"".
The Spanish cities of Cordoba, Seville and Toledo were some of the worst affected on Monday. Temperatures were expected to reach up to 44C in some areas.
In Seville, some people jumped off bridge to swim in the city's Guadalquivir river to try and escape the heat, according to AFP.
Spain's Guardia Civil urged people to drink at least three litres (five pints) of water a day and to avoid eating hot meals.
The heatwave is expected to spread, prompting concern in France and in the UK.
In 2003, a heatwave led to 70,000 more deaths than usual across Europe.
""I don't think this heatwave will have the same consequences as the one in 2003 because we weren't as prepared at that time,"" said French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal.
The high temperatures are expected to last at least until the end of the week.
The body's normal core temperature is 37-38C.
If it heats up to 39-40C, the brain tells the muscles to slow down and fatigue sets in. At 40-41C heat exhaustion is likely - and above 41C the body starts to shut down.
Chemical processes start to be affected, the cells inside the body deteriorate and there is a risk of multiple organ failure.
The body cannot even sweat at this point because blood flow to the skin stops, making it feel cold and clammy.
Heatstroke - which can occur at any temperature over 40C - requires professional medical help and if not treated immediately, chances of survival can be slim.
There are a number of things people can do to help themselves. These include:

581,"Yahoo owns a 43% stake in China's Alibaba group, which it acquired in 2005 for $1bn (Â£636m), and a part of Yahoo Japan.
It had been negotiating a complex swap-deal that was expected to save it billions of dollars in taxes.
However, various reports indicated that no agreement had been reached.
""I think the deal is either dead or it's going to take a lot longer to complete, which means we don't have a near-term catalyst; hence the selloff,"" said Brett Harris, an analyst with Gabelli & Co.
The stalemate in talks has come as a huge surprise.
Analysts and industry experts had expected the deal to be formalised, not least because trading in Alibaba's shares at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has been suspended since 9 February.
The reported failure of the talks is a big blow for Yahoo, which has been seeking to restructure its operations in a bid to boost its flagging fortunes.
The swap-deal, worth almost $17bn according to some estimates, was not only expected to save taxes, but also provide Yahoo with billions of dollars in cash.
Analysts said unless an agreement is reached soon, Yahoo may see its problems escalate further.
""The honeymoon is already over,'' said Colin Gillis an analyst with BGC Financial. ""Yahoo is probably looking at another year of turmoil.''
To make matters more complicated, Daniel Loeb, of hedge fund ThirdPoint, which owns more than 5% of Yahoo, launched a campaign to install his own directors on the firm's board.
""Installing the hand-picked choices of the current board does nothing to allay investor fears that Yahoo is poised to repeat the errors of its past,'' Mr Loeb wrote in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr Loeb's move comes just days after Yahoo announced changes to the board after Chairman Roy Bostock and three board members quit.
Their exit followed that of Jerry Yang, Yahoo's co-founder, who resigned from its board last month.
Yahoo said it had sought suggestions for new directors from several shareholders.
""We have received constructive suggestions from several of our major shareholders and, therefore, it is especially disappointing that Mr. Loeb has chosen a potentially disruptive path, just as the company is moving forward under new leadership to aggressively increase the value of Yahoo,'' the firm said in a statement.",Shares of Yahoo Japan fell 5% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on reports that talks regarding the swap of Yahoo's Asian assets had hit a stalemate.

583,"More than 1,800 cases are waiting to be processed by police, data collated by 5 Live Investigates has shown.
The most serious example, in Wiltshire, saw at least one case being delayed by more than 21 months.
Home Office minister Karen Bradley said the government had ""prioritised child sexual abuse as a national threat"".
Hi-tech crime units deal with the retrieval and examination of data from computers, mobile phones and other media devices, such as illegal images or details of inappropriate conversations with minors.
The evidence can be crucial in securing convictions against those who groom and abuse young people online.
More than half of the 40 UK police forces that responded to a Freedom of Information request from the programme reported delays of at least three months. Cases were ""waiting to be allocated"" to a member of staff in the hi-tech crime unit for analysis.
Five forces held devices that had not been examined after more than a year of the case being reported.
In Scotland, the oldest unallocated case dated back 10 months, in Wales, seven months, and in Northern Ireland, 18 months.
Louise began speaking online to a 35-year-old man when she was 13. He began to groom her and attempted to persuade her to visit him in person.
When her mother Amy alerted the police, she was astonished to be told it would take six months before forensic examination of her daughter's laptop and phone could begin.
""I was horrified, because what could they be doing in the six months?"" she said.
The family eventually waited 10 months for police to examine the evidence, but the case was dropped after they said Louise's phone no longer worked.
""How they can't get the phone to work in today's day and age I don't know. God forbid [the abuser] has done something to anyone else,"" Amy added.
Both names have been changed to protect their identity.
In July, a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) found delays of 12 months were ""not uncommon"", after examining 124 cases at random in six police forces.
It concluded such delays ""increase the risk to children"", with suspected offenders released on bail for prolonged periods of time while evidence was analysed.
Families of children who had been abused online said the failure by police to launch a full and immediate investigation into every case had left paedophiles free to continue their abuse.
Det Supt Guy Collins, of Lincolnshire Police, told the programme it was struggling to cope with the demand for hi-tech investigations into child sexual exploitation. It had a backlog of 10 months.
""We have to prioritise, that's the sad reality of life. We can't do everything straightaway,"" he explained.
He added that incidents involving high-risk suspects were always dealt with more swiftly than others, but admitted this meant other cases could be pushed back in the queue.
""It is a matter of absolute regret that we can't do all of those [cases] as quickly as we'd like to, but we do work very hard to protect children,"" he said.
Lincolnshire Police, like a number of forces, is now allocating additional resources to its hi-tech crime unit.
Karen Bradley, minister for preventing abuse and exploitation, said the government was ""committed to ensuring police have the resources they need, and have prioritised child sexual abuse as a national threat"".
She said the Child Abuse Image Database, launched in December 2014, ""will reduce the time taken to identify illegal images"".

584,"The trouble began on Monday after council contractors removed material from an anti-internment bonfire in the Markets area, near the city centre.
On Tuesday night, North Queen St was closed for a time due to a car on fire.
The road is near a bonfire in the New Lodge and it is understood a number of petrol bombs were thrown on the road.
However, police said the road had reopened to traffic shortly after 23:00 BST and was ""passable with care"".
Bonfires are traditionally lit in some republican areas to mark the anniversary of the introduction of internment - detention without trial - on 9 August 1971.
Council worker injured
Belfast City Council recently passed a motion to say that contractors would remove material from bonfire that posed a risk to safety.
However, on Tuesday evening the council told the BBC that it no longer has a contractor in place.
On Monday, shortly after material was taken away from a bonfire in the Markets, a number of parked cars were set on fire and petrol bombs, stones and other missiles were thrown at police.
Later that evening, trouble spread to other areas and a disused credit union building was set on fire in west Belfast.
Belfast City Council staff have also been targeted and on Tuesday, the council confirmed that one of its workers had been injured when a stone was thrown at a council vehicle.
The member of staff received a cut to the head when the windscreen of their vehicle was smashed.
A council spokesperson said it was one of two separate incidents in which stones were thrown at its vehicles.
It also confirmed that some street cleansing and commercial waste collections were restricted in the Markets, New Lodge and Divis areas on Tuesday.
Community centres in the New Lodge, Divis and Markets areas closed to the public at 17:00 BST.
In a statement about Monday's attacks, the PSNI said officers had dealt with ""localised disorder caused by a small group of people"" - some as young as 12 - in the Markets, New Lodge and North Queen Street areas.
Police are gathering evidence to bring those involved before the courts.
They have also appealed for parents to be aware of their children's whereabouts.
Police helped the fire service to deal with Monday night's blaze, which started at about 21:00 BST at the former credit union on Ross Road in west Belfast.
A bus was also damaged on the Falls Road a few hours later.
Supt Andrea McMullan said: ""I would like to reassure the public that police patrols across Belfast will be increased over the coming days in an effort to curb this violence.
""I would also call on those with influence in local communities to exert some control in an effort to dissuade any repetition of this behaviour.""
She described the attacks as ""senseless and unacceptable"".
""It achieves nothing - creating only inconvenience, disruption and misery for the local community,"" she added.
On Monday afternoon, three cars were destroyed after they were set on fire and five other vehicles were damaged by stones and paint in the Markets.
Later in the evening about 100 young people, including children aged 12, gathered in the area.
Alliance councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown described the scenes in Belfast as ""disgraceful"" and said they must be ""condemned in the strongest terms"".
""The responsibility for last night's behaviour rests solely with the people who carried it out,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster.
""The agreement to remove materials was agreed by all parties and I think this is not the first test of the issue.""
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Deirdre Hargey said residents in the Markets area were ""completely disgusted"" at the trouble.
""They don't want this and those involved in this disgusting behaviour are not representative of this community,"" she added.
Ms Hargey said she did not expect the level of anti-social behaviour and vandalism and did not believe it was ""completely linked"" to Belfast City Council's decision to tackle dangerous bonfires.
""There have been ongoing incidents and I think a large part of those who have been involved in incidents either in the Markets, or especially in Divis, are involved in vandalism every other day of the year,"" she added.

""They have just used this as an opportunity or an excuse to carry out this type of behaviour that they do every other day.""
She said she was concerned that there were ""older, more sinister elements involved in trying to encourage younger people into this activity"", but did not think they were dissident republicans.

On Twitter, the PSNI also ""thanked those in affected communities who helped settle tensions"" on Monday evening.

586,"He has been enjoying a first year off in a career which has spanned more than a quarter of a century, starting with his United debut in 1990 and coming to a temporary halt when he left the club as a coach 12 months ago.
Giggs has since been linked with several managerial vacancies - Sunderland and Middlesbrough among the most recent - and he was interviewed for the Swansea City job last October.
And while the Welshman has distanced himself from most speculation, there is one managerial post to which his name always appears to be closely connected: his country.
Chris Coleman has said the current World Cup campaign will be his last in charge of Wales, prompting many to suggest Giggs as his successor.
But when he is asked about the subject, Giggs is as fleet of foot as he was on the Old Trafford turf.
""With Cookie still in the job, I know what he said, but he could change his mind and carry on. So I think it's unfair to comment on that,"" he says.
""But he's done a great job, got some talented players there at the moment and I think the focus with Wales at the moment will be just winning those next four games and getting to the World Cup.""
OK, then, leaving Coleman out of the equation for now, theoretically, would Giggs at least want to manage Wales one day?
""I've seen Mark Hughes do it, Cookie [Coleman] do it, Gary Speed do it. It is a good job,"" he adds, still not giving an inch.
""And I think, when you are a coach, in my experience United would be a great job and coaching your country. Whether it be soon or in 10 or 15 years' time, we'll just have to wait and see.""
At this point, Giggs bursts into laughter, admitting with a mischievous grin: ""I've not given you an answer there, have I?""
You can understand why Giggs is reluctant to state outright his ambition of managing Wales.
He considers Coleman a friend and would not like to be seen to be eyeing his job.
Besides, if Wales' players and other coaches had their way, Coleman would change his mind and lead them beyond this campaign.
""That's totally up to Cookie. What he's done for Welsh football is remarkable,"" says Giggs.
""The whole team just captured the imagination at the (2016) Euros and a large part of that is down to him. The team he's built, the character he is, the team spirit.
""Teams are very much a shadow of the manager and I think this Welsh team is, knowing Chris as well I do, because he is larger than life, he is a great character, a great person to be around, but also a serious football man.""
As someone who has spent more than half of his life as a professional player or coach, Giggs is also very much a ""serious football man"".
But the success and all-consuming nature of his playing career means he is happy to spend some time away from the sport's firing line.
And although a year out may mean a clean break from your profession for most, football has still featured prominently in Giggs' sabbatical-of-sorts.
""Life's good. I've just completed my first year without football and it's been good,"" he says.
""I've been really busy doing some TV work for the Euros when I finished, then I went to India playing futsal, then a bit more punditry, doing some work for Uefa as a technical observer, which is good keeping me in football, and then just doing the normal dad stuff, watching your son play football, and watching Salford City, who I'm co-owner of. So it's been really busy and really good.
""You find out there's a whole big old world out there outside football, so I'm enjoying it.
""I think the pressure you put yourself under, be it as a player or a coach, that pressure's sort of come off. It's a strange feeling but it's good.
""I'm exactly where I was last summer, more or less got the next six months planned but, with the chance if a club does come in and want to talk, then I can do that.""
While being football-centric, what the last 12 months have given Giggs is some time away from the pressure cooker of the Premier League and its myriad, relentless demands.
That breathing space has allowed the Welshman to contemplate his options, speak to former managers - Sir Alex Ferguson most regularly - and also learn from coaches of other sports.
""Rugby is a big love for me because my dad [Danny Wilson] played rugby and I'm a rugby fan, whether it be league or union,"" Giggs says.
""I know Rob Howley [former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half and current assistant coach], I've met Warren Gatland [Wales and Lions head coach], I've spent an evening next to Eddie Jones [England head coach], who was constantly asking me about football - it was brilliant.
""I was asking him all about his coaching career, but he was asking me more about football and Sir Alex.""
Giggs appears to be refreshed by his time off, chatting excitedly about the previous 12 months and his future managerial career.
So does a 'gap year' like this revitalise one's passion for football?
""I think it does,"" Giggs says.
""It's brilliant I can step out because I was two years as a coach, you're constantly putting yourself under pressure, you're always thinking how you can improve the team, so to step away from it and be a bit more relaxed, you can look at things in a different way.
""I think I am ready [to return] but, also, I'm enjoying life and busy doing other stuff. If it happens then great, I'm ready because I've prepared myself as best I could with all my badges and the two years under Louis [van Gaal] at United.
""Whether that be in the lower leagues or a foreign club, I don't know. I honestly don't know and that's exciting for me because I've enjoyed this last year. But at some stage, I'm sure I will be back in football, coaching or managing.""","A little over a decade has passed since Ryan Giggs' final game for Wales yet, even at 43 years old, the former Manchester United winger can still be devilishly elusive."
587,"Fifteen people, including the bombers, died and more than 35 were injured in the attacks at a mosque and house of vigilante leader, they said.
More than 100 people died in similar attacks in the city two weeks ago.
Maiduguri is where Boko Haram Islamist militants were first based when they began their insurgency six years ago.
Some 17,000 people are said to have been killed in that time and attacks by the group have intensified since Muhammadu Buhari became president in May, vowing to defeat the insurgents.
The BBC's Abdullahi Kaura Abubakar in the capital, Abuja, says people were waiting for the final evening prayers when three suicide bombers struck the mosque.
The girl carrying the fourth bomb ran off into the nearby bush where her explosives detonated, killing her.
The vigilante leader was not at home when a suicide attacker struck his house, our reporter says.
Witnesses and security sources said the children were aged between nine and 15.
Earlier reports said all five of the bombers were girls.
Our correspondent says the attacks in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, come as the military says it is winning the war against Boko Haram.
In June, the military's headquarters were moved to the city as President Buhari wanted to centralise operations against the militants.
This year, the security forces have reclaimed most of the territory captured by Boko Haram fighters and freed a number of people kidnapped by the militant group.
But the boosted regional multinational force - central to Mr Buhari's strategy in defeating the militants - has not yet started operations in earnest because of reported funding difficulties, our reporter says.
Mr Buhari has given his newly appointed security chiefs until mid-November to defeat the fighters, who now have ties with Islamic State group.
More than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in April 2014 from the town of Chibok in Borno state have also yet to be found.

589,"The descriptions of the grey smog that's hung over the city get more and more extreme: ""Airmageddon"", the ""Airpocalypse"".
Walking out into Beijing's streets is like plunging into a swirling soup. The pollution swathes the city, wreathing everything in grey.
To get a sense of it, take a look at this slideshow of before and after pictures that give a sense of what China's toxic sky is really like.
A combination of coal emissions, dirty diesel and industrial gases, the smog has smothered everything for days. On Thursday, levels still hovered around the ""very unhealthy"" mark.
As the official Xinhua news agency reported, more flights were delayed at Tianjin close to Beijing. Visibility in Shandong province south of Beijing was just 50m (164ft).
On Thursday, too, there were reported to be more than 100 cars in crashes in Beijing. The roads were icy and slippery, but poor visibility cannot have helped.
What were billed as ""tough"" measures brought in by Beijing's government this week to try to improve things simply have not been enough.
On Tuesday, 103 factories were ordered to shut down, and a third of government cars ordered off the roads to combat what was already being described as the worst January smog since 1954.
But even state-controlled media now say Beijing's tough measures were ignored by city officials themselves.
More than 800 government vehicles ordered off the roads were still in use, and several construction sites ordered suspended were still active on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
So everyone now is looking at the weather forecast, hoping the smog will be blown away by winds forecast for Friday.
That's about the only thing that will bring some respite.
A bigger question will linger even after the smog has cleared: can China curb its polluting ways for good?
January's pollution has afflicted not just Beijing and its 20 million people, but more than 30 major cities and many tens of millions of people in addition.
As the Communist Party's English-language tabloid the Global Times put it in an editorial on Thursday: ""China's rapid development has brought us many benefits as well as accumulated many problems. Environmental protection should take up a more prominent position in China's future strategy even if it means that China's economic development will slow down.""
""Chinese people,"" the paper said, ""should not tolerate environmental pollution for the pursuit of wealth... We cannot keep going with the situation that we have today.""
The difficult bit is how to change the path China is on.
On the plus side, then, there is a growing realisation things have to change, and the media are now being allowed to debate the issue.
China's government seems to be in agreement. This week the cabinet approved an energy consumption ""control target"" for energy use by 2015.
On the minus side, that ""control target"" still means China's energy use will continue to expand, and, crucially, so will the burning of coal.
As Xinhua reported: ""to meet the target, average annual energy consumption growth should be controlled at around 4.3% between 2011 and 2015, lower than the 6.6-percent annual increase realized between 2006 and 2010"".
That means more emissions to come.
And as if to prove that changing China's habits will be hard, there is another worry on the immediate horizon.
Chinese New Year is just days away. Letting off vast quantities of fireworks is part of the Spring Festival celebrations, but the fireworks produce huge amounts of pollution.
""Setting off fireworks contributed greatly to air pollution in Beijing for half a month after Spring Festival in 2011,"" according to Du Shaozhong, former deputy director of Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
Eight million people had already posted messages on China's Weibo microblogs this week debating whether the fireworks should be stopped this year.
But the office in charge of Beijing's firework industry has said that residents can set off fireworks during the Spring Festival holiday according to the regulations, but that the office hopes residents will refrain from doing so, the China Daily reported.
I predict more smog.","All week in Beijing, in offices and homes, in lifts and shops, restaurants, taxis and buses, one topic has dominated conversation - Beijing's foul air."
590,"Despite their differences over Brexit and the legacy of the Troubles, the DUP and Sinn Féin maintained remarkable discipline after first the UUP, then the SDLP decided to leave the executive.
Until mid-December, the two parties' joint approach also extended to the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal.
When a BBC Spotlight investigation into the RHI affair stirred widespread public concern, both parties appeared to be making progress behind the scenes in arranging some kind of an investigation. This would have supplemented the Public Accounts Committee which had been taking evidence on the scandal since September.
But after former DUP minister Jonathan Bell broke ranks on a Nolan TV special on 15 December those attempts to manage the crisis within the walls of Stormont Castle broke down.
Then came the disastrous assembly sitting of 19 December, when the DUP decided to override Sinn Féin's concerns, pressing ahead with an Arlene Foster statement against Martin McGuinness's express wishes.
On the day, Sinn Féin's warning of ""grave consequences"" looked like the party might just be crying wolf. But in reality the die was cast, as republican grassroots anger grew.
The former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain reckons Arlene Foster's handling of the fall-out from the scandal has been a ""textbook case of how not to manage a crisis"". Certainly the DUP has appeared to be caught napping by the speed with which this affair developed - offering concessions, expressions of regret or offers of inquiries too late to appease its critics.
The heating scandal has ignited the election, but will the battle ahead be a referendum on the RHI scandal as the Stormont opposition wants?
For different reasons, both the DUP and Sinn Féin are keen on widening the battleground.
The DUP is framing the contest as an attempt to ""take Arlene Foster down"" and to push through investigations which would put soldiers and police officers in the dock over controversial Troubles killings.
Sinn Féin say it's all about the DUP's arrogance and the failure of both the DUP and the UK government to deliver on commitments in relation to the former jail at Maze/Long Kesh, the treatment of the Irish language and the logjam over the legacy of the troubles.
Over and above these policy matters, it look likely that any fresh talks on the other side of the election will have to consider potential structural changes at Stormont.
Should the mandatory coalition, whereby all the major parties have a right to be in government, be abandoned in favour of a more conventional voluntary coalition? Should weighted majority voting be introduced?
Should Northern Ireland have two joint first ministers rather than a first and deputy first?
Should there be radical changes to the petition of concern system which has led to frequent cross-community vetoes?  In the light of Brexit, are the cross-border institutions created under the Good Friday Agreement in need of reform?
All this looks like the stuff of talks which will last far longer than the three weeks the law allows to form a new executive after the March election.
Whilst the major parties may talk about all this and more, expect their critics to use the campaign ahead to remind voters what brought Stormont down.
It seems hard to imagine that the DUP and Sinn Féin won't emerge again as the main players. But we won't know until the votes are counted exactly what impact the negative publicity generated by the heating scandal has had on public opinion and party allegiance.
Could a shift in opinion, for example, endanger the DUP's power to veto measures without requiring the assistance of other parties, for which 30 MLAs are required?
That point might be rendered academic if there is no Stormont assembly in which to wield a petition of concern.
Nevertheless the public can have their say in this election, even if it is only to determine the relative weights the parties will be able to throw around in the potentially protracted negotiations coming up.","Although the assembly has wound down with almost clockwork-like inevitability, it should not be forgotten that the breakdown of Stormont wasn't pre-determined."
591,"In a paper looking at female genital cosmetic surgery, it says women and girls should realise that female genitalia come in all shapes and sizes.
They should also be told of the risks of this type of surgery.
Labiaplasties on the NHS have risen fivefold in the past 10 years.
Labiaplasty is the most common type of female genital cosmetic surgery, in which the size of the labia minora is reduced.
It can be a treatment for women who have concerns with hygiene, difficulties during sexual intercourse or discomfort when exercising, but some women and girls want surgery because of concerns about the way their genitalia look.
In extreme cases this can be linked to body dysmorphic disorder, which causes significant anxieties about body image.
Statistics show that more than 2,000 labiaplasty operations were performed in 2010 on the NHS.
Many more are carried out by private clinics but there are no figures available on these procedures, although the RCOG says ""the practice of labiaplasty is now widespread"".
Dame Suzi Leather, chair of the RCOG's ethics committee, said there was concern over the recent figures.
""Some women are requesting it solely for cosmetic reasons and these decisions are not always being made on an informed understanding of the normal variations that exist, but influenced by images from popular culture and the pornography industry.
""We need to inform women that everyone is unique and that variation in appearance is normal in the vast majority of cases,"" she said.
The RCOG paper recommends that women should be offered counselling and psychological treatment for problems such as ""body image distress"".
The paper says: ""Education, support and advice should be at the heart of clinical practice, with a sympathetic appreciation of female body insecurities.""
Official stats show that the labiaplasty procedure is not restricted to adults. In the past five years, 266 of these procedures have been carried out on girls under 14.
While the reasons for the procedures are unknown, they are likely to have been performed for medical reasons or to correct congenital abnormalities.
In another paper, published by the British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology (BritSPAG), clinicians are advised to inform girls under 18 that labiaplasty surgery before puberty is complete can lead to long-term problems.
Although no research has been carried out on these long-term risks, it is thought that damage to sexual function and sensitivity can occur after labiaplasty. Bleeding and wound infection can also occur in the short term.
The paper also recommends that girls showing signs of psychological problems should be referred to a paediatric clinical psychologist.
Consultant plastic surgeon Paul Banwell, from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, welcomed the recommendations published in both papers and said patients should always be given full, accurate information and be properly counselled before surgery.
But he said clinicians should also be sensitive to potential problems.
""An asymmetrical labia can lead to functional problems as well as aesthetic problems. Over 50% of my patients see me due to functional reasons. Only a small proportion are there for purely aesthetic reasons.""
He also said he had seen the number of patients requesting labiaplasty increase dramatically in the past few years.
Tim Goodacre, head of professional standards at the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons and a consultant plastic surgeon, said he supported the recommendations as a means of improving patient care.
""We would like to see tougher central regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry to help clamp down on anyone performing these operations unnecessarily, and without due consideration for patient care.""
But he said he found attempts to increase profits by encouraging more female genital procedures ""abhorrent"".
He added: ""We urge stringent and robust restrictions on advertising such operations with a firm objective to limit any material other than that with information only. All advertising that could in any way be seen as persuasive should be banned.""","""Designer vagina"" surgery should not be carried out on the NHS or on girls under the age of 18, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said."

That was not the case for everyone. Was it just the temptation to vent anger, or a pent-up polarisation, that filled Twitter and Facebook with such noxious opinion? Sweeping generalisations, calls for exclusion, purging, a police state.
Like whiplash after a collision, first you hit the steering wheel, then you get thrown back - twice broken.
What we know so far
Why was Brussels attacked?
Victims and survivors
I have no way to know what is inside the heads - let alone the hearts - of the bombers, though the signposts seem clear enough. They don't wage war, but they sow terror, fear, mistrust. ""Will I take the metro to get to the station?"" ""What's that large suitcase doing there?"" ""Does that man look suspicious?""
Division. Rage, and rage combined with fear and suspicion, makes hatred.
Terrorists know exactly how to fix a deadly cocktail, but are the rest of us compelled to drink it? Those who are now calling for an iron-fisted response to knock ""the Other"" senseless, are screaming out their impotence: their inability to comprehend this inhuman violence, but also their incomprehension of why this violence can exist.
We all share that inability and incomprehension today. The hate that comes with it, for some, at its worst creates for the low-minded a chance for political opportunism.
What we need are bridges and oneness. We should embrace everybody who rejects political violence. We need everyone.
Today the urgencies precede the nuances: we must care for the wounded, avert the imminent threat, bury the dead, clear the rubble. But the next task is to avoid having the wedge that the terrorist exploded into our society be driven deeper and steadier by angry citizens.
We urgently need an effective answer to violent radicalisation. Some people have been working on finding that answer, but we need it faster - as soon as we discard our torn garb, admit and acknowledge our grief, focus our anger and face the damage.
The work that lies in front of us is wide-ranging, but it should involve us all. It is easier to formulate the mission than to execute it, but we know that we cannot move forward without starting, immediately, by building a consensus around that mission, in order to make the reaction to these attacks inclusive instead of divisive.
The first priority of our governments - and we have lots of them in little Belgium - is to guarantee an effective security for all citizens, with all the resources that takes.
Those same governments should also as a priority invest in the society they have to protect: in trust, in the opportunity to have a future, in spaces of encounter, in democratic debate, in the belief that every call to defend ""our values"" does literally concern every citizen.
Our leaders must stand tall and adopt the manner of then Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg following Anders Breivik's attacks in 2012: ""We are still shocked by what has happened, but we will never give up our values. Our response is more democracy, more openness, and more humanity. We will answer hatred with love.""
Terror aims first at citizens, but they need not be solely its first victims; they can become the first responders. The unity we need embraces disagreement, because the society we need and want to defend is democratic, pluralistic and diverse.
We might understand today that ugly prejudices seep through the fissures that the attacks created in the social fabric, but tomorrow people of all persuasions and inspirations should join hands to mend both the fissures and the prejudices.
We urgently need new scaffolding to repair the bombed bridges and to reconstruct a (better) way of living together.
Words that are drenched in vitriol today are multiplied by social networks - those which always function, even when roads are blocked, trains stand still and mobile networks fail. They must be washed clean so they can be re-used for better purposes.
E pluribus unum, reads the United States seal: ""one from many"", unity from diversity. That is what Belgium, and the whole world, needs.
Belgium's motto is ""Unity makes strength"". Let us build that strength and use it to make this world both safe and just, for everyone.
Because alone, one-legged, we will not be able to span the gap created by the terrorists in Brussels.

593,"Mansfield 103.2 has reportedly been targeted eight times in the past month.
Outside broadcasts are being hijacked and replaced with The Winker's Song by comedy band Ivor Biggun.
The station said attempts to catch the culprit had so far failed and some listeners had complained ""their children have started humming the song"".
Station manager Tony Delahunty said the latest occasion was on Sunday when a live interview from the town's Party in the Market event was interrupted by a male voice shouting, then the song playing.
He said: ""We have had calls from people who have found it hilarious, while some have raised their concerns, including our competitors, and a lot of people in the industry are aghast at how difficult it is to stop these people.
""For listeners under the age of 11 travelling to school, it can be a very offensive thing for them to hear, so I just want it to stop.
""But I would also love to see who it is and have them caught.""
""There's absolutely nothing we can do,"" he continued.
""The first time we reported it to the police, but they said they would have to catch him in the act. Our transmitter people can't do anything because the person is using a mobile transmitter.""
Ivor Biggun is fronted by Robert ""Doc"" Cox, best known for his appearances on BBC TV's That's Life programme. The band has released four albums of double-entendre filled songs.
Mr Delahunty said communications regulator Ofcom had tried to track the offender on three occasions but had so far also been unsuccessful.
A spokesperson said: ""Ofcom takes malicious radio interference extremely seriously.
""Our Spectrum Engineering Officers are working closely with Mansfield 103.2 to trace and identify those responsible for these criminal activities.""
They added maliciously causing interference was a criminal act that carries a maximum punishment of two years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine.",An adult-themed song has been played on a local radio station in a series of rogue broadcasts.
594,"The Communists' president, Guillermo Teillier admitted his party approved an armed operation targeting the late General Augusto Pinochet in 1986.
Five troops escorting the leader died and 11 were injured in the ambush.
Around 3,000 people disappeared or died in Chile between 1973 and 1990 and 30,000 are believed to have been tortured by the authorities.
In an interview with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in April, Mr Teillier said his party had approved the failed attempt against Gen Pinochet's life and other armed operations in the 1980s.
It was ""nothing more than a reaction"" to what the government had been doing against the Communist leadership, Mr Teillier said.
The  women taking legal action say they want him jailed for the deaths.
""We want justice and equality before the law, that's all we want,"" one of the widows told Chilean Radio Bio Bio.
The recent 40th anniversary of the 1973 coup headed by Gen Pinochet re-ignited nationwide debate about responsibilities and punishment for crimes committed during the period of military rule.
The daughters of an ally of the deposed leader Salvador Allende, former President Michelle Bachelet, and of a Pinochet assistant, Evelyn Matthei, are pitted against each other in next months presidential elections, which has heightened the country's political sensitivity further.",The widows of three Chilean soldiers have launched legal action against the country's Communist Party leader.
595,"Documents and computer equipment were seized from the Mossack Fonseca office, officials said on Twitter.
The attorney general's office said the Mossack Fonseca sign had been removed a day earlier and quoted an employee as saying the firm was moving.
The leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore companies to evade tax.
The raid was overseen by El Salvador's Attorney General Douglas Melendez.
Mossack Fonseca's El Salvador branch was able to provide ""back office"" functions for the firm's clients all over the world, according to a document posted on Twitter by the attorney general's office.
Local news website El Faro reported (in Spanish) that Salvadoreans had used Mossack Fonseca to buy property in the country without declaring  the purchases to the Salvadorean authorities.
The firm has denied it has done anything wrong and says the information is being presented out of context.
Elsewhere:","Authorities in El Salvador have raided the offices of the Panama law firm at the centre of a massive data leak, the attorney general's office says."
596,"The semi-official Iranian Students News Agency (Isna) said the fire was in an ""explosive materials production unit"".
A pro-opposition website reported a huge blast near the Parchin military site, south-east of the capital, but this was not confirmed.
Parchin has been linked to Iran's controversial nuclear programme.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not been given access to the complex since 2005.
Analysts say the IAEA suspects Iran of experimenting with explosives capable of triggering a nuclear weapon at Parchin.
The pro-reform website Sahamnews said the explosion on Sunday evening was so intense that windows of buildings 15km (nine miles) away were shattered.
The glare from the blast could also be seen from a great distance, the report added.
Isna, quoting Iran's defence industries organisation, said: ""Unfortunately, due to the incident, two workers of this production unit lost their lives.""
It gave no further details.
Last month, the IAEA said more activity had been conducted at the Parchin military base.
It said Iran had also missed a deadline to answer further questions about its nuclear programme.
Iran is in negotiations with six world powers on a permanent agreement over its nuclear industry.
The West suspects Iran of trying to develop a nuclear weapon but Iranian leaders insist they only want atomic energy.
Talks are focused on lifting Western sanctions in exchange for a scaling-back of Iran's uranium enrichment programme, and a deadline for the agreement has been set for 24 November.","A fire and explosion at a military explosives facility near the Iranian capital Tehran has left at least two people dead, reports say."
597,"The program, designed to make voting easier for disabled residents, is part of a five-county pilot in the north-western state.
The counties are voting to nominate candidates to replace David Wu, who resigned from the US House of Representatives amid a sex scandal.
Voters in Oregon have cast their ballots entirely by post since 2000.
As voting gets under way on Tuesday, election workers will canvass the five Oregon counties bearing iPads and portable printers, stopping at parks, community centres and nursing homes.
Residents do not officially ""vote"" on the tablet, but instead use software developed by Oregon's elections division to cast their ballot, which is then printed out to be mailed back to the state.
The pilot program is intended to replace older tools designed for accessible voting in Oregon, often laptops with modifications that were stored in two suitcases.
Voters with poor vision can adjust the font size and screen colours, or have the candidate names read off.
One of the first users of the iPad ballot was 75-year-old Lewis Crews, who has severe arthritis and avoided using a pen to mark his ballot.
""It's a lot simpler for me. I think it's a great setup they got,"" Mr Crews told the Associated Press news agency.
If the pilot programme is successful, state elections officials say they will make the technology available across Oregon.
Apple donated five iPads for the scheme, and the state spent about $75,000 (Â£46,700) to develop the necessary software.
Oregon would need at least 72 iPads to make it a state-wide program, according to Steve Trout, state elections director.
That would bring the total cost for the computers to about $36,000, with a smaller total for the portable printers.
In its last two budgets, Oregon spent more than $325,000 on accessible voting tools.",Residents in parts of the US state of Oregon are to cast their votes by iPad during a special election on Tuesday.
598,"A third of people surveyed by housing charity Cymorth Cymru said health problems contributed to them losing their home.
Seven recommendations have been made to health boards, landlords and councils to ensure better support.
The Welsh Government said it welcomed the report and would consider its recommendations.
The charity - an umbrella body for providers of housing support and social care services - analysed responses from 332 homeless people from 21 out of 22 local authority areas.
It was commissioned by the Welsh Government to look at the experiences of people who had slept rough, stayed in a hostel or B&B, stayed with friends or relatives, or applied to the council as homeless.
A third of the sample stated their homelessness was caused, at least in part, by a health problem, when drug or alcohol problems were included as part of a broadly defined health issue.
Nearly a quarter who were admitted to hospital said they were discharged to the streets or ""unsuitable accommodation"".
More than two-thirds of respondents had not had a hepatitis B or flu vaccination and half the eligible female respondents did not have cervical smears or breast examinations on a regular basis.
Waiting times, the inability to make an appointment, as well as drug and alcohol problems are some of the factors which prevent people from accessing health services, the report said.
Cymorth Cymru director Katie Dalton said the results suggested poor health was a cause as well as an effect of homelessness.
""People can start to experience a physical or mental health problem and that can impact on their ability to engage in employment - they could see their income reduce or stop, not be able to afford their rent or mortgage and lose their home,"" she said.
""We know that around 30% of people who are homeless saw their health get worse in the past 12 months and that many of them face barriers to accessing a range of health services that could have prevented that deterioration from happening.""
Recommendations
Ms Dalton added: ""It's really important that we think more creatively to improve those health stats in futureâ€¦ this isn't necessarily about more resources - it's about being smarter.
""Significant proportions of homeless people use emergency departments and ambulances to access hospital - we believe that if early intervention was working, those people could be prevented from needing those services and reduce pressure on the NHS.
""We actually found that 63% of people who filled out the questionnaire didn't have a drug or alcohol problem - that's probably in contrast to what public perception is around substance misuse.""
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We continue to work closely with Public Health Wales, health boards, local authorities and homelessness organisations to ensure appropriate services are planned and delivered to meet the health needs of homeless people and those at risk of homelessness.""","Homeless people are struggling to access healthcare, according to a new Wales-wide report."
599,"The 32-year-old former Warwickshire seamer's last first-team appearance for the Hove side came in June 2014.
The right-armer took 199 wickets at an average of 32.38 in 63 first-class appearances for Sussex.
""It's been a frustrating 18 months. On the advice of the club's medical staff, I have decided not to pursue my first-class cricketing career,"" he said.
Anyon joined Sussex ahead of the 2010 campaign and became a consistent performer for their Championship side.
He took 55 first-class wickets at an average of 32.45 in 2011 and a further 50 at 28.64 in 2013.
Anyon also made 1,086 first-class runs during his spell with Sussex.
""I'm very fortunate to have played my best cricket at Sussex,"" he added.
""I'd like to make a special thank you to the medical staff and the Professional Cricketers' Association for all their help over the past 12 months. I wish the club success going forward.""",Sussex bowler James Anyon has announced his retirement after failing to recover from a knee injury.
